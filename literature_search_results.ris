AB  - Bioengineering is the art of applying engineering principles, techniques, and technologies to biology and medicine for general healthcare applications. Analyzing human biological samples such as blood, has become essential for physicians to diagnose and follow diseases evolution. Traditional blood cells counting techniques used in laboratories are time consuming and laborious. They can lead to inaccurate results due to the human intervention in this complicated process. In this paper, we propose an automated blood cells counting framework using convolutional neural network (CNN), instance segmentation, transfer learning, and mask R-CNN techniques. Red and white blood cells are identified, classified, and counted from microscopic blood smear images. The obtained results reveal highly detection rate of different blood cells. In addition, unlike other state-of-the-art techniques, our proposed method has the ability to identify overlapped and faded cells.

AB  - Malaria refers to a contagious mosquito-borne disease caused by parasite genus plasmodium transmitted by mosquito female Anopheles. As infected mosquito bites a person, the parasite multiplies in the host's liver and start destroying the red-cells. The disease is examined visually under the microscope for infected red-cells. This diagnosis depends upon the expertise and experience of pathologists and reports may vary in different laboratories doing a manual examination. Another way around, many machine learning techniques have been applied for spontaneous detection of blood smears. However, feature engineering is a challenging task that requires expertise to adjust positional and morphological features. Therefore, this study proposes a novel Stacked Convolutional Neural Network architecture that improves the automatic detection of malaria without considering the hand-crafted features. The 5-fold cross-validation process on 27, 558 cell images with equal instances of parasitized and uninfected cells on a publicly available dataset from the National Institute of health, the accuracy of our proposed model is 99.98%. Furthermore, the statistical results revealed that the proposed model is superior to the state-of-the-art models with 100% precision, 99.9% recall, and 99% f1-measure.

AB  - Leukemia is a worldwide disease. In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to build an automated, efficient and rapid leukemia diagnosis system. We demonstrate that it is possible to improve the precision of current techniques from the literature using the description power of well-known Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We extract features from a blood smear image using pre-trained CNNs in order to obtain an unique image description. Many feature selection techniques were evaluated and we chose PCA to select the features that are in the final descriptor. To classify the images on healthy and pathological we created an ensemble of classifiers with three individual classification algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron and Random Forest). In the tests we obtained an accuracy rate of 100%. Besides the high accuracy rate, the tests showed that our approach requires less processing time than the methods analyzed in this paper, considering the fact that our approach does not use segmentation to obtain specific cell regions from the blood smear image.

AB  - The inspection result of the white blood cell count is actually a critical part of medical diagnose. In the past five years, with the application of deep learning technique in the field of recognition of white blood cell, the classification accuracy of the white blood cell has been improved dramatically, however the extraction accuracy is still low, which limits the improvement of the total accuracy. In this paper, to solve the above problems, we proposed an algorithm of white blood cell recognition based on improved Faster RCNN. We improved RPN network by optimized the parameters of the original RPN network to make it have the ability to detect the small target. The results showed that the F1-Score improved compared with original Faster RCNN on self-built data set. The results show our method can extract the adhesion cells.

AB  - Computer-assisted algorithms have become a mainstay of biomedical applications to improve accuracy and reproducibility of repetitive tasks like manual segmentation and annotation. We propose a novel pipeline for red blood cell detection and counting in thin blood smear microscopy images, named RBCNet, using a dual deep learning architecture. RBCNet consists of a U-Net first stage for cell-cluster segmentation, followed by a second stage Faster R-CNN for detecting small cell objects within clusters, identified as connected components from the U-Net stage. RBCNet uses cell clustering instead of region proposals, which is robust to cell fragmentation, is highly scalable for detecting small objects or fine scale morphological structures in very large images, can be trained using non-overlapping tiles, and during inference is adaptive to the scale of cell-clusters with a low memory footprint. We tested our method on an archived collection of human malaria smears with nearly 200,000 labeled cells across 965 images from 193 patients, acquired in Bangladesh, with each patient contributing five images. Cell detection accuracy using RBCNet was higher than 97%. The novel dual cascade RBCNet architecture provides more accurate cell detections because the foreground cell-cluster masks from U-Net adaptively guide the detection stage, resulting in a notably higher true positive and lower false alarm rates, compared to traditional and other deep learning methods. The RBCNet pipeline implements a crucial step towards automated malaria diagnosis.

Generally, various image processing techniques are used to enhance the quality of images before the segmentation step. Therefore, the segmentation of blood cells is still a challenge. However, in this research, deep learning semantic segmentation - cutting-edge technology is applied for segmentation red blood cells and white blood cells in blood smear images. The experiment result shows that the global accuracy of our model yielded 89.45%. Besides, the accuracy of the segmentation of white blood cells, red blood cells, and the background of blood smear image reached 94.93%, 91.11%, and 87.32%, respectively.

AB  - In computer vision, traditional machine learning (TML) and deep learning (DL) methods have significantly contributed to the advancements of medical image analysis (MIA) by enhancing prediction accuracy, leading to appropriate planning and diagnosis. These methods substantially improved the diagnoses of automatic brain tumor and leukemia/blood cancer detection and can assist the hematologist and doctors by providing a second opinion. This review provides an in-depth analysis of available TML and DL techniques for MIA with a significant focus on leukocytes classification in blood smear images and other medical imaging domains, i.e., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT images, X-ray, and ultrasounds. The proposed review’s main impact is to find the most suitable TML and DL techniques in MIA, especially for leukocyte classification in blood smear images. The advanced DL techniques, particularly the evolving convolutional neural networks-based models in the MIA domain, are deeply investigated in this review article. The related literature study reveals that mainstream TML methods are vastly applied to microscopic blood smear images for white blood cells (WBC) analysis. They provide valuable information to medical specialists and help diagnose various hematic diseases such as AIDS and blood cancer (Leukaemia). Based on WBC related literature study and its extensive analysis presented in this study, we derive future research directions for scientists and practitioners working in the MIA domain.

T2  - 2018 3rd International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Applications (ICCIA)
AB  - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia can be diagnosed through a series of tests which include the minimally invasive microscopic examination of a stained peripheral blood smear. Manual microscopy is a slow process with variable accuracy depending on the laboratorian's skill level. Thus automating microscopy is a goal in cell biology. Current methods involve hand-selecting features from cell images as inputs to a variety of standard machine learning classifiers. Underrepresented in this filed, yet successful in practice, is the convolutional neural network that learns features from fine-grained images. This paper compares the performance of a convolutional neural network model with other models to determine the validity of using whole cell images rather than hand-selected features for acute lymphoblastic leukemia classification.

T2  - 2017 IEEE International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems (ICIIS)
AB  - It is important to analyze and classify the blood cells for the evaluation and diagnosis of many diseases. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a blood cancer mostly found in children below the age of 7-8 years. It can be fatal if left untreated. ALL cells are abnormal lymphocytes that have a condensed appearance to their chromatin. ALL can be detected through the analysis of white blood cells (WBCs) also called as leukocytes. Presently the morphological analysis of blood cells is performed manually by skilled operators, which makes it a time-taking and non-standardized process. This paper presents a novel deep learning approach to automate the process of detecting ALL from whole-slide blood smear images. Previous work in this domain deal with the isolation and classification of WBCs based on certain morphological image features. However, this work uses a deep network for simultaneous localization and classification of WBCs. The network makes use of Average Pooling layers to figure out the hot-spots of WBC locations in whole-slide images. Although this workflow fails to successfully figure out all the ALL lymphocytes in a whole-slide image, but it does performs very well in the task of predicting whether the blood smear image belongs to an ALL patient or not.

AB  - Complete blood cell count, which indicates the density of different blood cells in the human body is extremely important for evaluating the overall health of a person and also for detecting a wide range of disorders, including anemia, infection and leukemia. Hence, automating this task will not only increase the speed of diagnosis, but also lower the overall treatment cost. In this paper, we focus on using a convolution neural network to perform this complete blood cell count on blood smear images. The network is also trained to detect malarial pathogens in the blood, if present. Experiments show that the overall performance of the system has a mean average precision of over 0.95 when compared with the ground-truth. Furthermore, the system predicts the images containing malarial parasites as infected 100% of the time. The software is also ported to a low cost microcomputer for rapid prototyping.

AB  - Computer Aided System (CAS) is an automated, fast and accurate approach for detection and classification purposes. It is used to help experts or medical practitioner as a second opinion to analyze the blood smear image. It is done manually by some practitioners but it is time consuming and creates confusion as different pathologists give different observations and results as it is highly dependent on the experts' skills. Other than that, it is also challenging to analyze it manually as there are thousands of images. Some researchers used CAS by applying the machine learning to classify the data. However, significant features must be known before proceeding with classification process. In this paper, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied to classify the WBC types to identify Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). It is a better approach as no complex features need to be designed and it is a fast response program. Pre-trained models of deep learning which are AlexNet, GoogleNet and VGG-16 are compared to each other to find the model that can classify better. There are 260 images in IDB-2 database and 242 images in LISC database. Five types of WBC are classified for LISC database while for IDB-2 database, Lymphoblast and Non-Lymphoblast is classified specifically. As a result, for both database, AlexNet achieve the best result in terms of the training and testing accuracy for each class. Training accuracy for IDB-2 is 96.15% while testing accuracy for Lymphoblast and Non-Lymphoblast is 97.74% and 95.29% respectively. Training accuracy by AlexNet for LISC is 80.82% and testing accuracy is the highest for each class except Monocyte. Overall, AlexNet works better than the other two models for classification for both databases.

AB  - Peripheral Blood Smear (PBS) analysis is a vital routine test carried out by hematologists to assess some aspects of humans' health status. PBS analysis is prone to human errors and utilizing computer-based analysis can greatly enhance this process in terms of accuracy and cost. Recent approaches in learning algorithms, such as deep learning, are data hungry, but due to the scarcity of labeled medical images, researchers had to find viable alternative solutions to increase the size of available datasets. Synthetic datasets provide a promising solution to data scarcity, however, the complexity of blood smears' natural structure adds an extra layer of challenge to its synthesizing process. In this work, we propose a methodology that utilizes Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to create a novel balanced dataset of 2500 synthetic blood smears. This dataset, which was automatically annotated during the generation phase, will be made public for research purposes and covers 17 essential categories of blood cells. We proved the effectiveness of the proposed dataset by utilizing it for training a deep neural network, this model got a very high accuracy score of 98.72% when tested with the well known ALL-IDB dataset. The dataset also got the approval of 5 experienced hematologists to meet the general standards of making thin blood smears.

AB  - There has been an increase in the number of health issues in the recent decade with the evolution of various kinds of microorganisms and increasing pollution. The answer to prevent and protect ourselves from the diseases threatening our life lies at the microscopic level in our own blood. Blood consists of erythrocytes (RBCs), lymphocytes (WBCs) and platelets. Object detection is one of the many technologies which can help determine the different constituents of blood. It is a computer technology which deals with object occurrences of pre-defined classes such as cars, humans, buildings, etc. And has far-reaching applications such as self-driven cars, face recognition, face detection, etc. For object detection to be applicable in real-life situations, it should be fast and efficient in determining various entities in an image. There are many object detection techniques developed to make it more efficacious such as CNN and the family of R-CNN. In our research, we apply Faster R-CNN to the Blood Cell Count and Detection dataset to detect RBCs, WBCs, and Platelets. The number, shape and other meta-information or in other words any anomaly in the different constituents of blood can help in early detection of a wide array of issues and/or diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, sickle cell disease, etc. Our model detects a bounding box on the three blood constituents with a justifiable accuracy. It identifies all three constituents in the blood smear slide and forms a bounding box around them with their respective labels.

AB  - Leukemia is one of TOP 10 cancers in China, especially to young children and elderly. Treating Leukemia at the early stage can significantly increase the cure rate. However, detecting early stage Leukemia, i.e, finding a small amount of blood cells among massive normal cells, is both technically challenge and labor intensive. Therefore, we designed an AI-powered diagnoser for precise identification of white blood cells. The precise identification has two steps, blood image collecting and cell classification. First, with the help of doctors in Ruijing Hospital, we have been collecting about 1,000 high-quality labeled blood cell samples each week and accumulated more than 200,000 samples in total. This is the largest blood cell image dataset for leukemia in China. Second, based on these blood cell samples, we adopted the ResNet-variant classification method and achieved above 95% accuracy in 17 subtypes of white blood cells. The classification accuracy is comparable to experienced doctors in Ruijing Hospital. Third, models are trained on the latest Intel Knights Landing 7210 Platform with Intel Omni-Path interconnections. Applying MKL-optimized matrix operatiors and RDMA-enable comunication library (PSM) shortens the training time from more than 6 hours to less than an hour. Our AI-powered diagnoser can reduce the time and the cost of early Leukemia diagnosis from one week to one day, and 1,000 USD to 100 USD, respectively.

AB  - Diagnosis of microcytic hypochromia is done by measuring certain characteristics changes in the count of blood cell and related indices. Complete blood count test (CBC) is the common process for measuring these characteristic changes. However, the CBC test cannot be completely relied upon since there are chances of false diagnosis as these characteristics are also related to other disorders. In order to rectify the same, other expensive and lengthy tests need to be done which leads to further delay in accurate diagnosis and which may prove detrimental. In an attempt to find the solution to this problem, this paper proposes a method that uses feature fusion for classification of microcytic hypochromia. Feature fusion means combining blood smear image features extracted by the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and clinical features from CBC test. This fused data-set is further used to predict microcytic hypochromia. After obtaining fused data set we use linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce data set dimensions which further results in less computational overhead. To differentiate between microcytic hypochromia patients and normal persons, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network classification models are used. In order to check the performance of the above model, various evaluation metrics are used. Results achieved from the proposed method reflect that fused data set can effectively improve the identification ratio with a very limited number of patients diagnostic images and clinical data (10 for normal and 10 for β-thalassemia) and feed-forward back-propagation neural network on this data set achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99%, 1.00, and 0.98, respectively. The limited number of patients reduces the system complexity and researcher’s time for getting data from different hospital to train the network.

AB  - Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a blood cell cancer type characterized by an increased number of immature lymphocytes. It is one of the leading cancer inflicted causes of death among children and affected around 876.000 people globally in 2015. In this work, we describe methods used for the “Classification of Normal versus Malignant Cells in B-ALL White Blood Cancer Microscopic Images” ISBI challenge. Due to the morphological similarity between malignant and normal cells, the classification of these cell types is a very challenging task, even for human experts. Deep learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) provides state-of-the-art techniques for image classification, even with limited annotation data, based on techniques like transfer learning and data augmentation. Our solution to tackle this classification problem is based upon advanced augmentation techniques to counter overfitting the small dataset and transfer learning with adaptive learning rates. Additionally, we incorporated a basic attention mechanism based on a region proposal subnetwork to boost our results for this competition. The ResNet 18 network with an additional regression head achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.8284 on the final test set and 0.8746 on the preliminary test set.

AB  - This paper presents a new automated peripheral blood smear analysis system, Shonit™ [1]. It consists of an automated microscope for capturing microscopic images of a blood sample, and a software component for analysis of the images. The software component employs an ensemble of deep learning models to analyze peripheral blood smear images for localization and classification of the three major blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets) and their subtypes [2]. We present the results of the classification and segmentation on a large variety of blood samples. The specificity and sensitivity of identification for the common cell types were above 98% and 91% respectively. The primary advantage of Shonit™over other automated blood smear analysis systems [3, 4, 5] is its robustness to quality variation in the blood smears, and the low cost of its image capture device.

AB  - The health care sector is totally different from any other industry. It is a high priority sector and consumers expect the highest level of care and services regardless of cost. The health care sector has not achieved society’s expectations, even though the sector consumes a huge percentage of national budgets. Mostly, the interpretations of medical data are analyzed by medical experts. In terms of a medical expert interpreting images, this is quite limited due to its subjectivity and the complexity of the images; extensive variations exist between experts and fatigue sets in due to their heavy workload. Following the success of deep learning in other real-world applications, it is seen as also providing exciting and accurate solutions for medical imaging, and is seen as a key method for future applications in the health care sector. In this chapter, we discuss state-of-the-art deep learning architecture and its optimization when used for medical image segmentation and classification. The chapter closes with a discussion of the challenges of deep learning methods with regard to medical imaging and open research issue.

AB  - This survey presents an overview of recent attempts on semantic segmentation on biomedical images using deep learning techniques. Deep learning is a revolutionary technology and recent advances in it have made it possible to improve the performance of semantic segmentation methods, which are common tasks in medical imaging. Recently, semantic segmentation is a breakthrough in biomedical image segmentation. Semantic segmentation is the process of classifying each and every pixel of an image into a class. This paper explicitly deals with various semantic segmentation methods applied to different biomedical images. Further, diverse architectures of deep neural networks for semantic segmentation of images such as U-Net, fully convolution network (FCN), and SegNet are examined. In brief, datasets namely Dristhi-GS, ALL-IDB1, H & E stained images, Flair-MRI Brats 2015, and Japanese Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT) are studied. In this paper, a complete taxonomy of various methods of semantic segmentation for medical images is given.

AU  - Anwar, Shamama

T2  - Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing
AB  - Leukaemia is a type of blood cancer which mainly occurs when bone marrow produces excess white blood cells in our body. This disease not only affects adult but also is a common cancer type among children. Treatment of leukaemia depends on its type and how far the disease has spread in the body. Leukaemia is classified into two types depending on how rapidly it grows: acute and chronic leukaemia. The early diagnosis of this disease is vital for effective treatment and recovery. This paper presents an automated diagnostic system to detect acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The model uses labeled microscopic blood smear images to detect the malignant leukaemia cells. The current work uses data obtained from the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Image DataBase (ALL_IDB) and performs various data augmentation techniques to increase the number of training data which in effect reduces the over-training problem. The model has been trained on 515 images using a fivefold validation technique achieving an accuracy of 95.54% and further tested on the remaining 221 images achieving almost 100% accuracy during most of the trials, maintaining an average of 99.5% accuracy. The method does not need any pre-processing or segmentation technique and works efficiently on raw data. This method can, hence, prove profitable for pathologist in diagnosing ALL efficiently.

AB  - Deep learning has been successfully applied in classification of white blood cells (WBCs), however, accuracy and processing time are found to be less than optimal hindering it from getting its full potential. This is due to imbalanced dataset, intra-class compactness, inter-class separability and overfitting problems. The main research idea is to enhance the classification and prediction accuracy of blood images while lowering processing time through the use of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architecture by using the modified loss function.  The proposed system consists of a deep neural convolution network (DCNN) that will improve the classification accuracy by using modified loss function along with regularization. Firstly, images are pre-processed and fed through DCNN that contains different layers with different activation function for the feature extraction and classification. Along with modified loss function with regularization, weight function aids in the classification of WBCs by considering weights of samples belonging to each class for compensating the error arising due to imbalanced dataset. The processing time will be counted by each image to check the time enhancement.  The classification accuracy and processing time are achieved using the dataset-master. Our proposed solution obtains better classification performance in the given dataset comparing with other previous methods. The proposed system enhanced the classification accuracy of 98.92% from 96.1% and a decrease in processing time from 0.354 to 0.216 s. Less time will be required by our proposed solution for achieving the model convergence with 9 epochs against the current convergence time of 13.5 epochs on average, epoch is the formation white blood cells (WBCs) and the development of granular cells.  The proposed solution modified loss function to solve the adverse effect caused due to imbalance dataset by considering weight and use regularization technique for overfitting problem.

AB  - White blood cells play a vital role in monitoring health condition of a person. Change in count and/or appearance of these cells indicate hematological disorders. Manual microscopic evaluation of white blood cells is the gold standard method, but the result depends on skill and experience of the hematologist. In this paper we present a comparative study of feature extraction using two approaches for classification of white blood cells. In the first approach, features were extracted using traditional image processing method and in the second approach we employed AlexNet which is a pre-trained convolutional neural network as feature generator. We used neural network for classification of WBCs. The results demonstrate that, classification result is slightly better for the features extracted using the convolutional neural network approach compared to traditional image processing approach. The average accuracy and sensitivity of 99% was obtained for classification of white blood cells. Hence, any one of these methods can be used for classification of WBCs depending availability of data and required resources.

AB  - Acute Lymphocytic or Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a virulent form of blood cancer that affects white blood cells and the bone-marrow–spongy tissue. At the start of ALL, immature white blood cells proliferate and replace healthy cells in the bone marrow. ALL progresses quickly and can be fatal within a few months if not treated. Computer assisted diagnosis and prognosis of ALL, therefore, has the potential to save many lives but requires high accuracy classification of malignant cells which is challenging due to the visual similarity between normal and malignant cells. In this work, we employ a custom-built deep learning model for the classification of immature lymphoblasts and normal cells. Our model is an ensemble of convolutional and recurrent neural networks. It also exploits the spectral features of the cells by using discrete cosine transform in conjunction with an RNN. The proposed classifier has been validated using multiple experiments. Our approach is able to achieve substantial performance gains when compared to, conventional, stand-alone CNN- and RNN-based methods. The highest accuracy achieved by our model is 86.6%.

AB  - The Complete Blood Count (CBC) is a medical diagnostic test concerned with identifying and counting basic blood cells such as red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC) and platelets. The computerized automation of CBC has been a challenging problem in medical diagnostics. In this work we describe a subcomponent system for the CBC to perform the automatic classification of WBC cells into one of five WBC types in low resolution cytological images. We describe feature extraction and consider three classifiers: a support vector machine (SVM) using standard intensity and histogram features, an SVM with features extracted by a kernel principal component analysis of the intensity and histogram features, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) which takes the entire image as input. The proposed classifiers were compared through experiments conducted on low resolution cytological images of normal blood smears. The best results were obtained with the CNN solution with recognition rates either higher or comparable to the SVM-based classifiers for all five types of WBCs.

AB  - Leukemia is one of the deadliest diseases in human life, it is a type of cancer that hits blood cells. The task of diagnosing Leukemia is time consuming and tedious for doctors; it is also challenging to determine the level and type of Leukemia. The diagnoses of Leukemia are achieved through identifying the changes on the White blood Cells (WBC). WBCs are divided into five types: Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Basophils, Monocytes, and Lymphocytes. In this paper, the authors propose a Convolutional Neural Network to detect and classify normal white blood cells. The program will learn about the shape and type of normal WBC by performing the following two tasks. The first task is identifying high level features of a normal white blood cell. The second task is classifying the normal white blood cell according to its type. Using a Convolutional Neural Network CNN, the system will be able to detect normal WBCs by comparing them with the high-level features of normal WBC. This process of identifying and classifying WBC can be vital for doctors and medical staff to make a decision. The proposed network achieves an accuracy up to 95.47% with a dataset including 10,000 blood cell images.

AB  - Counting and analysis of leukocyte on peripheral blood smears have great significance to assist doctors’ pathological diagnosis. Thus, accurate and automatic segmentation of leukocyte from blood smear images is a fundamental task. To achieve this task, we proposed an end-to-end peripheral blood leukocyte segmentation method based on deep convolutional neural networks, where the encoder-decoder network is its basic structure. Specifically, the proposed method first utilizes the feature encoder to extract multi-scale leukocyte features. Then, the context-aware feature decoder is introduced to reconstruct the segmentation mask of leukocyte. Finally, each layer generates a prediction map in the decoder module, and all these prediction maps are averaged to be the final prediction map. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed qualitative and quantitative comparisons with several existing methods on two publicly available datasets and a private dataset. Experimental results validate that the proposed method is superior for peripheral blood leukocyte image segmentation in terms of accuracy and robustness.

AB  - Deep learning emerges as a promising technology for automated peripheral blood smear analysis and hematologic diagnosis. A big challenge to deep learning model is the accuracy drop when facing image corruptions caused by different smear preparation and digitalization operations. In order to serve the real applications of peripheral blood analysis, a practical deep learning classifier needs to be robust against a wide range of corruptions. In this paper, we first investigate the comprehensive corruption types for peripheral blood smear image and establish the benchmark dataset Smear-C simulating the real physical cause factors. Then we propose a novel method SmearRobust which can easily fit into the existing neural networks and improve the robustness. Experimental results show that SmearRobust can significantly enhance the robustness upon Smear-C dataset. Furthermore, the proposed corruption simulation algorithms and the robust learning method can be potentially applied to bone marrow smear and general pathology areas.

AB  - Blood cell counts are one of the vital signs that play a major role in medical diagnostics. The process of estimating complete blood count (CBC) is either expensive or time taking depending on the technique that is used for counting. A manual differential technique, that is often used to get authentic count and abnormalities present in a stained blood smear, requires a lot of human expertise and time. Dedicated efforts are given to make the classification and counting process of blood profiles automatic and robust. In this paper, first, we build a neural network-based multiclass classifier that can classify between RBC, WBC, and platelets. However, we demonstrate that the presence of a small amount of random noise can drastically decrease the performance of the designed classifier. Thus, we design a preprocessing network to enhance the quality of the input image so that the classifier can faithfully classify the blood cells even in adverse imaging conditions.

AB  - Cell classification by computer assistant technique has become a popular topic recently. It is crucial to do early disease diagnosis with less cost. In order to find efficient, high accuracy computer assistant methods, The International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) held the classification of normal vs malignant cells (C-NMC) challenge 2019 for classifying B-ALL white blood cancer microscopic images. Our team deploys several state-of-the-art CNN architectures and uses an ensemble method named stacking to boost the final prediction performance, which helped to get the eighth place in the preliminary phase and tenth place in the final phase. Weighted F1 scores evaluated on our model were 0.8674 and 0.8552, for the preliminary and final phase, respectively. It is a relatively reasonable result in such an expertise required task.

AB  - Identification and analysis of leukocytes (white blood cells, WBC) in blood smear images play a vital role in the diagnosis of many diseases, including infections, leukemia, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, it remains difficult to accurately segment and identify leukocytes under variable imaging conditions, such as variable light conditions and staining degrees, the presence of dyeing impurities, and large variations in cell appearances, e.g., size, color, and shape of cells. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end leukocyte segmentation algorithm that uses pixel-level prior information for supervised training of a deep convolutional neural network. Specifically, a context-aware feature encoder is first introduced to extract multi-scale leukocyte features. Then, a feature refinement module based on the residual network is designed to extract more discriminative features. Finally, a finer segmentation mask of leukocytes is reconstructed by a feature decoded based on the feature maps. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons of real-world datasets show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art leukocyte segmentation performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness.

AB  - Many image analysis tasks involve the automatic segmentation and counting of objects with specific characteristics. However, we find that current approaches look to either segment objects or count them through bounding boxes, and those methodologies that both segment and count struggle with co-located and overlapping objects. This restricts our capabilities when, for example, we require the area covered by particular objects as well as the number of those objects present, especially when we have a large amount of images to obtain this information for. In this paper, we address this by proposing a Dual-Output U-Net. DO-U-Net is an Encoder-Decoder style, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) for object segmentation and counting in image processing. Our proposed architecture achieves precision and sensitivity superior to other, similar models by producing two target outputs: a segmentation mask and an edge mask. Two case studies are used to demonstrate the capabilities of DO-U-Net: locating and counting Internally Displaced People (IDP) tents in satellite imagery, and the segmentation and counting of erythrocytes in blood smears. The model was demonstrated to work with a relatively small training dataset, achieving a sensitivity of 98.69% for IDP camps of the fixed resolution, and 94.66% for a scale-invariant IDP model. DO-U-Net achieved a sensitivity of 99.07% on the erythrocytes dataset. DO-U-Net has a reduced memory footprint, allowing for training and deployment on a machine with a lower to mid-range GPU, making it accessible to a wider audience, including non-governmental organisations (NGOs) providing humanitarian aid, as well as health care organisations.

AB  - White Blood Cells also known as leukocytes plays an important role in the human body by increasing the immunity by fighting against infectious diseases. The classification of White Blood Cells, plays an important role in detection of a disease in an individual. The classification can also assist with the identification of diseases like infections, allergies, anemia, leukemia, cancer, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), etc. that are caused due to anomalies in the immune system. This classification will assist the hematologist distinguish the type of White Blood Cells present in human body and find the root cause of diseases. Currently there are a large amount of research going on in this field. Considering a huge potential in the significance of classification of WBCs, we will be using a deep learning technique Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) which can classify the images of WBCs into its subtypes namely, Neutrophil, Eosinophil, Lymphocyte and Monocyte. In this paper, we will be reporting the results of various experiments executed on the Blood Cell Classification and Detection (BCCD) dataset using CNN.

AB  - Hematological disorders are disorders pertaining to blood cell anomalies. Diseases varying from anemia, malaria to leukemia are diagnosed via careful scrutiny of peripheral blood smears (PBS) prepared on glass slides. Usually, the tests are performed in laboratory settings by skilled professionals and clinicians to reach a diagnosis. However, human error due to fatigue and observational oversights might lead to a misdiagnosis. Automated systems are therefore developed to assist the diagnostic procedure of clinicians and provide them with meaningful insights. Computer aided diagnosis is mostly concerned with the evaluation of medical images by employing various image processing techniques. The chapter gives an overview of the stages in developing a computer aided diagnosis system. It concentrates toward the common approaches in designing and developing an assisting system to detect abnormalities in blood samples using image processing tools alongside tools like machine learning and deep learning. The chapter addresses steps like pre-processing, image segmentation, feature extraction, pattern recognition and classification while focusing on specific studies on blood disorders.

AB  - Cell nuclei segmentation is a fundamental task in microscopy image analysis, based on which multiple biological related analysis can be performed. Although deep learning (DL) based techniques have achieved state-of-the-art performances in image segmentation tasks, these methods are usually complex and require support of powerful computing resources. In addition, it is impractical to allocate advanced computing resources to each dark- or bright-field microscopy, which is widely employed in vast clinical institutions, considering the cost of medical exams. Thus, it is essential to develop accurate DL based segmentation algorithms working with resources-constraint computing.

AB  - Pathology is an important field in modern medicine. In particular, the step of nuclei segmentation is an important step in cancer analysis, diagnosis, and grading because cancer analysis, diagnosis, classification, and grading are highly dependent on the quality (accuracy) of nuclei segmentation. In the conventional cancer diagnosis, pathologists analyze biopsies to make diagnostic and prognostic assessments, mainly based on the cell morphology and architecture distribution. In recent years, computerized approaches are rapidly developing in the field of digital pathology, and applications related to nuclei detection, segmentation and classification are increasing. These approaches will play an important role of minimizing human intervention, integrating relevant second opinions, and providing traceable clinical information. In the past, much effort has been devoted to automation of nuclei segmentation and methods to deal with nuclei complex structure. This review provides the summary of the techniques and experimental materials used for nuclei segmentation.

AB  - Compared to the analysis of blood cells in microscope images of peripheral blood, bone marrow images are much more challenging for automated cell classification: not only are the cells more densely distributed, there are also significantly more types of hematopoietic cells. So far, several attempts have been made using custom image features and prior knowledge in form of cytoplasm and nuclei segmentations or a restricted number of cell types in peripheral blood. Instead of hand-crafting features and classification methods for bone marrow images, we compare several well-known methods on our more challenging dataset and we show that while generic classical machine learning approaches cannot compete with specialized algorithms, even out-of-the-box deep learning methods already yield valuable results. Our findings indicate that automated analysis of bone marrow images becomes possible with the advent of convolutional neural networks.

AB  - Automatic detection of Leukemic B-lymphoblast cells from normal cells is both crucial and difficult with subject variability being a major obstacle. While deep learning models are widely adopted in image recognition and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, deep learning models in their vanilla form do not provide an estimate of prediction uncertainty. This is especially problematic when there is a high discrepancy between training and testing data such as in blood smear images where subject level variability and sample noise from staining and illumination are non-negligible. To address these issues, we propose a novel ensemble method by weighting each base model according to its respective predictive confidence obtained from Monte Carlo dropout. Our ensemble method can effectively prevent overfitting and increases classification performance compared to any single model result. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model’s ability to identify samples that do not fall in the training data distribution. We achieved 0.8929 prediction score according to the leaderboard on the SBILab challenge website.

AB  - The recent success of deep learning approaches relies partly on large amounts of well annotated training data. For natural images object annotation is easy and cheap. For biomedical images however, annotation crucially depends on the availability of a trained expert whose time is typically expensive and scarce. To ensure efficient annotation, only the most relevant objects should be presented to the expert. Currently, no approach exists that allows to select those for a multiclass detection problem. Here, we present an active learning framework that identifies the most relevant samples from a large set of not annotated data for further expert annotation. Applied to brightfield images of red blood cells with seven subtypes, we train a faster R-CNN for single cell identification and classification, calculate a novel confidence score using dropout variational inference and select relevant images for annotation based on (i) the confidence of the single cell detection and (ii) the rareness of the classes contained in the image. We show that our approach leads to a drastic increase of prediction accuracy with already few annotated images. Our original approach improves classification of red blood cell subtypes and speeds up the annotation. This important step in diagnosing blood diseases will profit from our framework as well as many other clinical challenges that suffer from the lack of annotated training data.

AB  - Bone marrow smear examination is an indispensable diagnostic tool in the evaluation of hematological diseases, but the process of manual differential count is labor extensive. In this study, we developed an automatic system with integrated scanning hardware and machine learning-based software to perform differential cell count on bone marrow smears to assist diagnosis. The initial development of the artificial neural network was based on 3000 marrow smear samples retrospectively archived from Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine between June 2016 and December 2018. The preliminary field validating test of the system was based on 124 marrow smears newly collected from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University between April 2019 and November 2019. The study was performed in parallel of machine automatic recognition with conventional manual differential count by pathologists using the microscope. We selected representative 600,000 marrow cell images as training set of the algorithm, followed by random captured 30,867 cell images for validation. In validation, the overall accuracy of automatic cell classification was 90.1% (95% CI, 89.8–90.5%). In a preliminary field validating test, the reliability coefficient (ICC) of cell series proportion between the two analysis methods were high (ICC ≥ 0.883, P < 0.0001) and the results by the two analysis methods were consistent for granulocytes and erythrocytes. The system was effective in cell classification and differential cell count on marrow smears. It provides a useful digital tool in the screening and evaluation of various hematological disorders.

AB  - Digital pathology and microscope image analysis is widely used in comprehensive studies of cell morphology. Identification and analysis of leukocytes in blood smear images, acquired from bright field microscope, are vital for diagnosing many diseases such as hepatitis, leukaemia and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The major challenge for robust and accurate identification and segmentation of leukocyte in blood smear images lays in the large variations of cell appearance such as size, colour and shape of cells, the adhesion between leukocytes (white blood cells, WBCs) and erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs), and the emergence of substantial dyeing impurities in blood smear images. In this paper, an end-to-end leukocyte localization and segmentation method is proposed, named LeukocyteMask, in which pixel-level prior information is utilized for supervisor training of a deep convolutional neural network, which is then employed to locate the region of interests (ROI) of leukocyte, and finally segmentation mask of leukocyte is obtained based on the extracted ROI by forward propagation of the network. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the propose method and both the quantitative and qualitative comparisons with existing methods indicate that LeukocyteMask achieves a state-of-the-art performance for the segmentation of leukocyte in terms of robustness and accuracy .

AB  - Automatic recognition and classification of leukocytes helps medical practitioners to diagnose various blood-related diseases by analysing their percentages. Different researchers have come up with different algorithms that use traditional learning for the classification of different types of leukocytes. In contrast to traditional learning, in which no knowledge is retained that can be transferred from one model to another, our proposed algorithm uses deep learning approach for segmentation and classification. The proposed algorithm has two-stage pipelining consisting of semantic segmentation and transfer learning-based classification. Here, we have used pre-trained networks, utilizing knowledge from previously learned tasks, called DeepLabv3+ for segmentation of leukocytes and AlexNet to classify five categories of leukocytes in peripheral blood from whole blood smear microscopic images. For experimentation, a microscopic blood image dataset consisting of 257 cells belonging to five types of leukocytes was used. The results obtained from experiments show that the proposed algorithm attained a mean average precision of 98.42% (@IoU = 0.7) in white blood cell localization and a classification accuracy of 98.87 ± 1% compared to existing methods.

AB  - Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a major public health priority throughout much of the world, affecting millions of people. In many regions, particularly those in resource-limited settings, SCD is not consistently diagnosed. In Africa, where the majority of SCD patients reside, more than 50% of the 0.2-0.3 million children born with SCD each year will die from it; many of these deaths are in fact preventable with correct diagnosis and treatment. Here, we present a deep learning framework which can perform automatic screening of sickle cells in blood smears using a smartphone microscope. This framework uses two distinct, complementary deep neural networks. The first neural network enhances and standardizes the blood smear images captured by the smartphone microscope, spatially and spectrally matching the image quality of a laboratory-grade benchtop microscope. The second network acts on the output of the first image enhancement neural network and is used to perform the semantic segmentation between healthy and sickle cells within a blood smear. These segmented images are then used to rapidly determine the SCD diagnosis per patient. We blindly tested this mobile sickle cell detection method using blood smears from 96 unique patients (including 32 SCD patients) that were imaged by our smartphone microscope, and achieved ~98% accuracy, with an area-under-the-curve of 0.998. With its high accuracy, this mobile and cost-effective method has the potential to be used as a screening tool for SCD and other blood cell disorders in resource-limited settings.

AB  - A complete blood cell count is an important test in medical diagnosis to evaluate overall health condition. Traditionally blood cells are counted manually using haemocytometer along with other laboratory equipment's and chemical compounds, which is a time-consuming and tedious task. In this work, the authors present a machine learning approach for automatic identification and counting of three types of blood cells using 'you only look once' (YOLO) object detection and classification algorithm. YOLO framework has been trained with a modified configuration BCCD Dataset of blood smear images to automatically identify and count red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Moreover, this study with other convolutional neural network architectures considering architecture complexity, reported accuracy, and running time with this framework and compare the accuracy of the models for blood cells detection. They also tested the trained model on smear images from a different dataset and found that the learned models are generalised. Overall the computer-aided system of detection and counting enables us to count blood cells from smear images in less than a second, which is useful for practical applications.

AB  - Background and objectives
White blood cells (WBCs) differential counting yields valued information about human health and disease. The current developed automated cell morphology equipments perform differential count which is based on blood smear image analysis. Previous identification systems for WBCs consist of successive dependent stages; pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. There is a real need to employ deep learning methodologies so that the performance of previous WBCs identification systems can be increased. Classifying small limited datasets through deep learning systems is a major challenge and should be investigated.
Methods
In this paper, we propose a novel identification system for WBCs based on deep convolutional neural networks. Two methodologies based on transfer learning are followed: transfer learning based on deep activation features and fine-tuning of existed deep networks. Deep acrivation featues are extracted from several pre-trained networks and employed in a traditional identification system. Moreover, a novel end-to-end convolutional deep architecture called “WBCsNet” is proposed and built from scratch. Finally, a limited balanced WBCs dataset classification is performed through the WBCsNet as a pre-trained network.
Results
During our experiments, three different public WBCs datasets (2551 images) have been used which contain 5 healthy WBCs types. The overall system accuracy achieved by the proposed WBCsNet is (96.1%) which is more than different transfer learning approaches or even the previous traditional identification system. We also present features visualization for the WBCsNet activation which reflects higher response than the pre-trained activated one.
Conclusion
a novel WBCs identification system based on deep learning theory is proposed and a high performance WBCsNet can be employed as a pre-trained network.

AB  - Object segmentation is an important step in the workflow of computational pathology. Deep learning based models generally require large amount of labeled data for precise and reliable prediction. However, collecting labeled data is expensive because it often requires expert knowledge, particularly in medical imaging domain where labels are the result of a time-consuming analysis made by one or more human experts. As nuclei, cells and glands are fundamental objects for downstream analysis in computational pathology/cytology, in this paper we propose NuClick, a CNN-based approach to speed up collecting annotations for these objects requiring minimum interaction from the annotator. We show that for nuclei and cells in histology and cytology images, one click inside each object is enough for NuClick to yield a precise annotation. For multicellular structures such as glands, we propose a novel approach to provide the NuClick with a squiggle as a guiding signal, enabling it to segment the glandular boundaries. These supervisory signals are fed to the network as auxiliary inputs along with RGB channels. With detailed experiments, we show that NuClick is applicable to a wide range of object scales, robust against variations in the user input, adaptable to new domains, and delivers reliable annotations. An instance segmentation model trained on masks generated by NuClick achieved the first rank in LYON19 challenge. As exemplar outputs of our framework, we are releasing two datasets: 1) a dataset of lymphocyte annotations within IHC images, and 2) a dataset of segmented WBCs in blood smear images.

AB  - Importance: Decades of effort have been devoted to establishing an automated microscopic diagnosis of malaria, but there are challenges in achieving expert-level performance in real-world clinical settings because publicly available annotated data for benchmark and validation are required.
Objective: To assess an expert-level malaria detection algorithm using a publicly available benchmark image data set.
Design, Setting, and Participants: In this diagnostic study, clinically validated malaria image data sets, the Taiwan Images for Malaria Eradication (TIME), were created by digitizing thin blood smears acquired from patients with malaria selected from the biobank of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2018. These smear images were annotated by 4 clinical laboratory scientists who worked in medical centers in Taiwan and trained for malaria microscopic diagnosis at the national reference laboratory of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. With TIME, a convolutional neural network-based object detection algorithm was developed for identification of malaria-infected red blood cells. A diagnostic challenge using another independent data set within TIME was performed to compare the algorithm performance against that of human experts as clinical validation.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Performance on detecting Plasmodium falciparum-infected blood cells was measured by average precision, and performance on detecting P falciparum infection at the image level was measured using sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
Results: The TIME data sets contained 8145 images of 36 blood smears from patients with suspected malaria (30 P falciparum-positive and 6 P falciparum-negative smears) that had reliable annotations. For clinical validation, the average precision was 0.885 for detecting P falciparum-infected blood cells and 0.838 for ring form. For detecting P falciparum infection on blood smear images, the algorithm had expert-level performance (sensitivity, 0.995; specificity, 0.900; AUC, 0.997 [95% CI, 0.993-0.999]), especially in detecting ring form (sensitivity, 0.968; specificity, 0.960; AUC, 0.995 [95% CI, 0.990-0.998]) compared with experienced microscopists (mean sensitivity, 0.995 [95% CI, 0.993-0.998]; mean specificity, 0.955 [95% CI, 0.885-1.000]).
Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that a clinically validated expert-level malaria detection algorithm can be developed by using reliable data sets.

AB  - Previous works on segmentation of SEM (scanning electron microscope) blood cell image ignore the semantic segmentation approach of whole-slide blood cell segmentation. In the proposed work, we address the problem of whole-slide blood cell segmentation using the semantic segmentation approach. We design a novel convolutional encoder-decoder framework along with VGG-16 as the pixel-level feature extraction model. The proposed framework comprises 3 main steps: First, all the original images along with manually generated ground truth masks of each blood cell type are passed through the preprocessing stage. In the preprocessing stage, pixel-level labeling, RGB to grayscale conversion of masked image and pixel fusing, and unity mask generation are performed. After that, VGG16 is loaded into the system, which acts as a pretrained pixel-level feature extraction model. In the third step, the training process is initiated on the proposed model. We have evaluated our network performance on three evaluation metrics. We obtained outstanding results with respect to classwise, as well as global and mean accuracies. Our system achieved classwise accuracies of 97.45%, 93.34%, and 85.11% for RBCs, WBCs, and platelets, respectively, while global and mean accuracies remain 97.18% and 91.96%, respectively.

AB  - This pilot study presented a capsule architecture-based classification model named WBCaps to automatically recognize the five types of white blood cells (WBC) from normal peripheral blood smears. The entire WBCs identification workflow including two sections were also reported here. The first section automatically located the WBCs from the whole slice of blood smears through a three-step image segmentation method including color normalization, color deconvolution and cell extraction. In the second section, the extracted cells were fed into WBCaps, which was a network cascaded by traditional convolutional layer, primary capsule layer and representation capsule layer, to generate the type prediction. We employed 3-fold cross validation to validate the proposed WBCs identification method on a small clinical dataset and yielded precision 0.99, recall 0.99 and F1-score 0.99. The result outperformed that of ResNet (precision 0.97, recall 0.97, F1-score 0.97) and VGG (precision 0.97, recall 0.97, F1-score 0.98). The proposed model could be a promising clinical tool for hematology analyzer to facilitate the cytological and morphological examination.

AB  - Automated classification and morphological analysis of white blood cells has been addressed since last four decades, but there is no optimal method which can be used as decision support system in laboratories due to biologically complex nature of the cells. Automated blood cell analysis facilitates quick and objective results and can also handle massive amount of data without compromising with efficiency. In the present study, we demonstrate classification of white blood cells into six types namely lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and abnormal cells. We provide the comparison of traditional image processing approach and deep learning methods for classification of white blood cells. We evaluated neural network classifier results for hand-crafted features and obtained the average accuracy of 99.8%. We also used full training and transfer learning approaches of convolutional neural network for the classification. An accuracy around 99% was obtained for full training CNN.

AB  - Microscopic examination of peripheral blood plays an important role in the field of diagnosis and control of major diseases. Peripheral leukocyte recognition by manual requires medical technicians to observe blood smears through light microscopy, using their experience and expertise to discriminate and analyze different cells, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive and subjective. The traditional systems based on feature engineering often need to ensure successful segmentation and then manually extract certain quantitative and qualitative features for recognition but still remaining a limitation of poor robustness. The classification pipeline based on convolutional neural network is of automatic feature extraction and free of segmentation but hard to deal with multiple object recognition. In this paper, we take leukocyte recognition as object detection task and apply two remarkable object detection approaches, Single Shot Multibox Detector and An Incremental Improvement Version of You Only Look Once. To improve recognition performance, some key factors involving these object detection approaches are explored and the detection models are generated using the train set of 14,700 annotated images. Finally, we evaluate these detection models on test sets consisting of 1,120 annotated images and 7,868 labeled single object images corresponding to 11 categories of peripheral leukocytes, respectively. A best mean average precision of 93.10% and mean accuracy of 90.09% are achieved while the inference time is 53 ms per image on a NVIDIA GTX1080Ti GPU.

AB  - The detection and classification of white blood cells (WBCs, also known as Leukocytes) is a hot issue because of its important applications in disease diagnosis. Nowadays the morphological analysis of blood cells is operated manually by skilled operators, which results in some drawbacks such as slowness of the analysis, a non-standard accuracy, and the dependence on the operator's skills. Although there have been many papers studying the detection of WBCs or classification of WBCs independently, few papers consider them together. This paper proposes an automatic detection and classification system for WBCs from peripheral blood images. It firstly proposes an algorithm to detect WBCs from the microscope images based on the simple relation of colors R, B and morphological operation. Then a granularity feature (pairwise rotation invariant co-occurrence local binary pattern, PRICoLBP feature) and SVM are applied to classify eosinophil and basophil from other WBCs firstly. Lastly, convolution neural networks are used to extract features in high level from WBCs automatically, and a random forest is applied to these features to recognize the other three kinds of WBCs: neutrophil, monocyte and lymphocyte. Some detection experiments on Cellavison database and ALL-IDB database show that our proposed detection method has better effect almost than iterative threshold method with less cost time, and some classification experiments show that our proposed classification method has better accuracy almost than some other methods.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) offers opportunities to advance pathological diagnosis, especially with increasing trends in digitalizing microscopic images. Diagnosing leukemia is time‐consuming and challenging in many areas globally and there is a growing trend in utilizing ML techniques for its diagnosis. In this review, we aimed to describe the literature of ML utilization in the diagnosis of the four common types of leukemia: acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Using a strict selection criterion, utilizing MeSH terminology and Boolean logic, an electronic search of MEDLINE and IEEE Xplore Digital Library was performed. The electronic search was complemented by handsearching of references of related studies and the top results of Google Scholar. The full texts of 58 articles were reviewed, out of which, 22 studies were included. The number of studies discussing ALL, AML, CLL, and CML was 12, 8, 3, and 1, respectively. No studies were prospectively applying algorithms in real‐world scenarios. Majority of studies had small and homogenous samples and used supervised learning for classification tasks. 91% of the studies were performed after 2010, and 74% of the included studies applied ML algorithms to microscopic diagnosis of leukemia. The included studies illustrated the need to develop the field of ML research, including the transformation from solely designing algorithms to practically applying them clinically.

AB  - Advanced laboratory technology has made blood testing more automated, robust and tests are being implemented comprehensively. Leukocytes type differentiation is a critical hematological images analysis step of blood film as it delivers valuable information in diagnosis of several diseases. At present, the morphological examination of leukocytes is done manually and this process is very tedious, inefficient and slow. Although many white blood cells detection or classification techniques are presented by different researchers, there is still a need of fully automated and an efficient detection system of blood cells with its particular types for an early diagnosis of leukemia. This paper presents a technique for the classification of protuberant types of leukocytes and early diagnosis of leukemia. The work is divided into the following main stages: (a) image augmentation, (b) wavelet composition and decomposition for attaining high and low frequency bands of the cell image, (c) convolutional neural network (CNN) training model for the classification of leukocytes categories and (d) prediction of leukemia. The main intention behind this study is to develop an automated, robust and efficient classification and detection system of leukocytes for microscopic blood images.

AB  - • A generalized white blood cell (WBC) nucleus segmentation method is proposed. • We localize WBC by showing a statistical analysis on four public databases. • We compare the proposed WBC nucleus segmentation method on four public databases. • A new CNN model is proposed to classify four types of white blood cell. • We evaluate and compare the proposed CNN model by using nine evaluation metrics. White blood cells (WBCs) play a remarkable role in the human immune system. To diagnose blood-related diseases, pathologists need to consider the characteristics of WBC. The characteristics of WBC can be defined based on the morphological properties of WBC nucleus. Therefore, nucleus segmentation plays a vital role to classify the WBC image and it is an important part of the medical diagnosis system. In this study, color space conversion and k-means algorithm based new WBC nucleus segmentation method is proposed. Then we localize the WBC based on the location of segmented nucleus to separate them from the entire blood smear image. To classify the localized WBC image, we propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN) model by combining the concept of fusing the features of first and last convolutional layers, and propagating the input image to the convolutional layer. We also use a dropout layer for preventing the model from overfitting problem. We show the effectiveness of our proposed nucleus segmentation method by evaluating with seven quality metrics and comparing with other methods on four public databases. We achieve average accuracy of 98.61% and more than 97% on each public database. We also evaluate our proposed CNN model by using nine classification metrics and achieve an overall accuracy of 96% on BCCD test database. To validate the generalization capability of our proposed CNN model, we show the training and testing accuracy and loss curves for random test set of BCCD database. Further, we compare the performance of our proposed CNN model with four state-of-the-art CNN models (biomedical image classifier) by measuring the value of evaluation metrics.

AB  - In microscopy, laboratory tests make use of cell counters or flow cytometers to perform tests on blood cells, like the complete blood count, rapidly. However, a manual blood smear examination is still needed to verify the counter results and to monitor patients under therapy. Moreover, the manual inspection permits the description of the cells' appearance, as well as any abnormalities. Unfortunately, manual analysis is long and tedious, and its result can be subjective and error-prone. Nevertheless, using image processing techniques, it is possible to automate the entire workflow, both reducing the operators' workload and improving the diagnosis results. In this paper, we propose a novel method for recognizing white blood cells from microscopic blood images and classify them as healthy or affected by leukemia. The presented system is tested on public datasets for leukemia detection, the SMC-IDB, the IUMS-IDB, and the ALL-IDB. The results are promising, achieving 100% accuracy for the first two datasets and 99.7% for the ALL-IDB in white cells detection and 94.1% in leukemia classification, outperforming the state-of-the-art.

AB  - Accurate segmentation of leukocytes is a primary and very difficult problem because of the non-uniform color, uneven illumination of blood smear image. An improved algorithm based on feature weight adaptive K-means clustering for extracting complex leukocytes is proposed. In this paper, the initial clustering center is chosen according to the histogram distribution of a cell image; this approach not only improves the clustering effect but also reduces the time complexity of the algorithm from O (n) to O (1). Prior to white blood cell extraction, the color space is decomposed. Then, color space decomposition and K-means clustering are combined for image segmentation. And then adherent complex white blood cells are separated again based on watershed algorithm. Finally, classification experiments based on convolutional neural network were performed and compared with other methods; 368 representative images were used to evaluate the performance of our method. The proposed segmentation method achieves 95.81% segmentation accuracy. The classification accuracy reached a maximum of 98.96%, and the average classification time is 0.39 s. Compared with those in the existing algorithms for WBC, convolutional neural network classification method not only presents obvious advantages but can also be easily improved.

AB  - Establishing an accurate count and classification of leukocytes commonly known as WBC (white blood cells) is crucial in the assessment and detection of illness of an individual, which involves complications on the immune system that leads to various types of diseases including infections, anemia, leukemia, cancer, AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) etc. The two widely used methods to count WBC is with the use of hematology analyzer and manual counting. Currently, in the age of modernization there has been numerous research in the field of image processing incorporated with various segmentation and classification techniques to be able to generate alternatives for WBC classification and counting. However, the accuracy of these existing methods could still be improved. Thus, in this paper we proposed a new method that could segment various types of WBCs: monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils from a microscopic blood image using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) saturation component with blob analysis for segmentation and incorporate CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for counting which in turn generates more accurate results.

AB  - This works gives an account of evaluation of white blood cell differential counts via computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system and hematology rules. Leukocytes, also called white blood cells (WBCs) play main role of the immune system. Leukocyte is responsible for phagocytosis and immunity and therefore in defense against infection involving the fatal diseases incidence and mortality related issues. Admittedly, microscopic examination of blood samples is a time consuming, expensive and error-prone task. A manual diagnosis would search for specific Leukocytes and number abnormalities in the blood slides while complete blood count (CBC) examination is performed. Complications may arise from the large number of varying samples including different types of Leukocytes, related sub-types and concentration in blood, which makes the analysis prone to human error. This process can be automated by computerized techniques which are more reliable and economical. In essence, we seek to determine a fast, accurate mechanism for classification and gather information about distribution of white blood evidences which may help to diagnose the degree of any abnormalities during CBC test. In this work, we consider the problem of pre-processing and supervised classification of white blood cells into their four primary types including Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Lymphocytes, and Monocytes using a consecutive proposed deep learning framework. For first step, this research proposes three consecutive pre-processing calculations namely are color distortion; bounding box distortion (crop) and image flipping mirroring. In second phase, white blood cell recognition performed with hierarchy topological feature extraction using Inception and ResNet architectures. Finally, the results obtained from the preliminary analysis of cell classification with (11200) training samples and 1244 white blood cells evaluation data set are presented in confusion matrices and interpreted using accuracy rate, and false positive with the classification framework being validated with experiments conducted on poor quality blood images sized 320 × 240 pixels. The deferential outcomes in the challenging cell detection task, as shown in result section, indicate that there is a significant achievement in using Inception and ResNet architecture with proposed settings. Our framework detects on average 100% of the four main white blood cell types using ResNet V1 50 while also alternative promising result with 99.84% and 99.46% accuracy rate obtained with ResNet V1 152 and ResNet 101, respectively with 3000 epochs and fine-tuning all layers. Further statistical confusion matrix tests revealed that this work achieved 1, 0.9979, 0.9989 sensitivity values when area under the curve (AUC) scores above 1, 0.9992, 0.9833 on three proposed techniques. In addition, current work shows negligible and small false negative 0, 2, 1 and substantial false positive with 0, 0, 5 values in Leukocytes detection.

AB  - Peripheral blood smear analysis is a common practice to evaluate health status of a person. Many disorders such as malaria, anemia, leukemia, thrombocytopenia, sickle cell anemia etc., can be diagnosed by evaluating blood cells. Many groups have reported methods to automate blood smear analysis for detection of specific disorders for diagnostic purposes. In this paper, we have summarized the methods used to analyze peripheral blood smears using image processing techniques. We have categorized these methods into three groups based on approaches such as WBC analysis, RBC analysis and platelet analysis. We conclude that there is a need for a method of automation to match with human evaluation process and rule out any abnormality present in the blood smear. It is desirable for studies on automation of peripheral blood smear analysis to focus on development of robust method to handle illumination and color shade variations. Also, it is desirable to design a method which could collect all the abnormal regions from all views of a specimen to limit the manual evaluation to those regions making it more feasible for telemedicine applications.

AB  - The most common and dangerous defect of red blood cells (RBCS) is shape abnormality, The primary detection and confirmation of anaemic stage(shape abnormality) is based on haemoglobin level or manual microscopic examination of peripheral blood smears. The problem of classifying the abnormal cells manually under microscope is that it consumes time, working on huge number of sample manually is burdensome which leads to poor result quality with unnecessary medication leading to life trait to the patient and cause eye fatique to the technicians. This paper proposed a method to classify Rbc’s abnormalities based on deformed shaped RBCs image by using SVM and Deep learning in comparison on the RBCs cell Classification. Classifying normal cells of RBCs indicate a healthy patient and Classifying anemic abnormalities indicate presence of disease. And is very important in medical field to detect and classify disease in early stage because it saves and protects human lives. The patients waiting time for blood test is longer because the time taken to generate the result of the blood test is more due to high demand and less equipment. This lead to comparison of the two classifiers in order to predict the one that will best perform on RBCs in order to achieved maximum accuracy for the classification. This study shows that SVM classifier can classify the cells in all condition either small or large dataset   while deep learning performs mainly on large and very large dataset which RBCs dataset will be generated in large amount in order to work successfully with the state of the earth on RBCs deformity.

AB  - Deep Learning (DL) approaches have been explored in different modalities of biomedical image analysis, and they provide superior performance against alternative machine learning approaches. In this paper, we have evaluated the performance of a deep learning model called the Inception Recurrent Residual Convolutional Neural Network (IRRCNN) for White Blood Cell (WBC) and Red Blood Cell (RBC) classification. We have tested the performance of the IRRCNN approach on two publicly available blood cell datasets for both RBC and WBC classification obtained from the Yale School of medicine and CellaVision respectively. The experimental results show almost 100% recognition accuracy for the WBC dataset and 99.94% testing accuracy for RBC classification. This is approximately a 1.4% and 2.35% improvement when compared to existing deep learning-based approaches.

AB  - Classification of the white blood cells (WBCs) in blood smear images is essential for providing important information to the physicians. In addition, manual analyzing of the blood smear images for determining the various WBCs is a time-consuming issue for the physicians. In this paper, a hybrid method is proposed for the classification of the WBCs. Image processing (IP) and machine learning (ML) are used to determine and classify the WBCs in blood smear images. In the IP perspective, various IP algorithms are used to segment the WBCs and in ML perspective, feature extraction and classification are employed. RGB to HSV transformation, color to gray tone conversion, filtering operations, thresholding, and morphological processes are used for determining the WBCs. Median filtering and adaptive histogram equalization are used for filtering and image enhancement and Otsu thresholding is considered for thresholding due to its simplicity. Shape based features and deep features are used for characterization of the WBCs and long-short term memory (LSTM) network is employed for classification. A dataset containing totally 349 blood smear images is considered in the evaluation of the proposed method. 10-fold cross validation is used in experiments and classification accuracy is calculated accordingly. While the shape based features produce 80.0% accuracy, deep features obtain 82.9% accuracy. When both shape and deep features are concatenated, 85.7% accuracy score is obtained.

AB  - Over the past decade, the lens-free imaging technique has been considered a good way to reduce the volume and the cost of cell analysis tools. However, limited by lens-free optical amplification, the cell imaging not only has low resolution but also has diffraction phenomenon in lens-free system. Therefore, there is a major problem, which traditional methods can hardly classify diffracted cell images in the system. At present, the state-of-the-art algorithm in image classification is to use the convolution neural network (CNN). Fortunately, the training of CNN method is fully accordant with the application requirements of classification of white blood cells (WBCs). In this paper, we proposed a technique for WBCs classification based on CNN in the lens-free imaging system. According to the test, the accuracy of this method for WBCs classification can reach to 90%, and it has a very broad application prospect in point-of-care testing.

AB  - Leukocytes present in the blood are responsible for providing protection against infections. Differential Blood Count is a medical procedure conducted by pathologists to identify and count the different kinds of leukocytes in blood to aid the identification of diseases. This procedure requires the pathologists to perform microscopic evaluation which is time consuming and human involvement in the process may produce error prone results. Many computer-aided systems have been designed to perform segmentation and categorization of leukocytes from the peripheral blood smear images to automate the process and reduce manual involvement. This paper presents a survey of different techniques proposed by researchers for segmentation and classification of leukocytes accentuating its pros and cons and the scope for future research in this context is also discussed.

AB  - Leukemia is a pathology that affects young people and adults, causing premature death and several other symptoms. Computer-aided systems can be used to reduce the possibility of prescribing inappropriate treatments and assist specialists in the diagnosis of this disease. There is a growing use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the classification and diagnosis of medical image problems. However, the training of CNNs requires a large set of images. To overcome this problem, we use transfer learning to extract images features for further classification. We tested three state-of-the-art CNN architectures and the features were selected according to their gain ratios and used as input to the Support Vector Machine classifier. The proposed methodology aims to correctly classify images with different characteristics derived from different image databases and does not require a segmentation process. We built a new database from the union of three distinct databases presented in the literature to validate the proposed methodology. The proposed methodology achieved hit rates above 99% and outperformed nine methods found in the literature.

AB  - The white blood cell (WBC) segmentation and classification is a challenging task, due to the different shapes of the nucleus, cytoplasm and the number of lobes. The purpose of this paper is to provide a method for fast and accurate segmentation of leukocyte in smear images by a convolutional neural network (CNN) model and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) approach. The first step is the usage of white balance and selfdual multiscale morphological toggle (SMMT) to increase the contrast between the nucleus and cytoplasm. To segment, each WBC and corresponded nucleus and cytoplasm regions, a CNN model with 10 layers and GMM are used, respectively. In the postprocessing step, removing undesired objects by size, closing, and filling morphological operations are applied to each segment. The proposed method is validated on peripheral smear blood images in Cellavision dataset. This dataset contains 27 images which include different types of normal leukocytes. In order to evaluate the proposed method, the Dice coefficient, Jaccard and F1-score are used. The experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy for segmentation results of different types of WBC.

AB  - This paper presents the recognition for WHO classification of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) subtypes. The two ALL subtypes considered are T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (pre-T) and B-lymphoblastic leukaemia (pre-B). They exhibit various characteristics which make it difficult to distinguish between subtypes from their mature cells, lymphocytes. In a common approach, handcrafted features must be well designed for this complex domain-specific problem. With deep learning approach, handcrafted feature engineering can be eliminated because a deep learning method can automate this task through the multilayer architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this work, we implement a CNN classifier to explore the feasibility of deep learning approach to identify lymphocytes and ALL subtypes, and this approach is benchmarked against a dominant approach of support vector machines (SVMs) applying handcrafted feature engineering. Additionally, two traditional machine learning classifiers, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and random forest are also applied for the comparison. The experiments show that our CNN classifier delivers better performance to identify normal lymphocytes and pre-B cells. This shows a great potential for image classification with no requirement of multiple preprocessing steps from feature engineering.

AB  - Reliable recognition of malignant white blood cells is a key step in the diagnosis of haematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukaemia. Microscopic morphological examination of blood cells is usually performed by trained human examiners, making the process tedious, time-consuming and hard to standardize. Here, we compile an annotated image dataset of over 18,000 white blood cells, use it to train a convolutional neural network for leukocyte classification and evaluate the network’s performance by comparing to inter- and intra-expert variability. The network classifies the most important cell types with high accuracy. It also allows us to decide two clinically relevant questions with human-level performance: (1) if a given cell has blast character and (2) if it belongs to the cell types normally present in non-pathological blood smears. Our approach holds the potential to be used as a classification aid for examining much larger numbers of cells in a smear than can usually be done by a human expert. This will allow clinicians to recognize malignant cell populations with lower prevalence at an earlier stage of the disease.

AB  - The white blood cell differential count of the bone marrow provides information concerning the distribution of immature and mature cells within maturation stages. The results of such examinations are important for the diagnosis of various diseases and for follow-up care after chemotherapy. However, manual, labor-intensive methods to determine the differential count lead to inter- and intra-variations among the results obtained by hematologists. Therefore, an automated system to conduct the white blood cell differential count is highly desirable, but several difficulties hinder progress. There are variations in the white blood cells of each maturation stage, small inter-class differences within each stage, and variations in images because of the different acquisition and staining processes. Moreover, a large number of classes need to be classified for bone marrow smear analysis, and the high density of touching cells in bone marrow smears renders difficult the segmentation of single cells, which is crucial to traditional image processing and machine learning. Few studies have attempted to discriminate bone marrow cells, and even these have either discriminated only a few classes or yielded insufficient performance. In this study, we propose an automated white blood cell differential counting system from bone marrow smear images using a dual-stage convolutional neural network (CNN). A total of 2,174 patch images were collected for training and testing. The dual-stage CNN classified images into 10 classes of the myeloid and erythroid maturation series, and achieved an accuracy of 97.06%, a precision of 97.13%, a recall of 97.06%, and an F-1 score of 97.1%. The proposed method not only showed high classification performance, but also successfully classified raw images without single cell segmentation and manual feature extraction by implementing CNN. Moreover, it demonstrated rotation and location invariance. These results highlight the promise of the proposed method as an automated white blood cell differential count system.

AB  - Morphologic profiling of the erythrocyte population is a widely used and clinically valuable diagnostic modality, but one that relies on a slow manual process associated with significant labor cost and limited reproducibility. Automated profiling of erythrocytes from digital images by capable machine learning approaches would augment the throughput and value of morphologic analysis. To this end, we sought to evaluate the performance of leading implementation strategies for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when applied to classification of erythrocytes based on morphology.Erythrocytes were manually classified into 1 of 10 classes using a custom-developed Web application. Using recent literature to guide architectural considerations for neural network design, we implemented a “very deep” CNN, consisting of &gt;150 layers, with dense shortcut connections.The final database comprised 3737 labeled cells. Ensemble model predictions on unseen data demonstrated a harmonic mean of recall and precision metrics of 92.70% and 89.39%, respectively. Of the 748 cells in the test set, 23 misclassification errors were made, with a correct classification frequency of 90.60%, represented as a harmonic mean across the 10 morphologic classes.These findings indicate that erythrocyte morphology profiles could be measured with a high degree of accuracy with “very deep” CNNs. Further, these data support future efforts to expand classes and optimize practical performance in a clinical environment as a prelude to full implementation as a clinical tool.

AU  - Banerjee, Sriparna

T2  - IET Computer Vision
AB  - The proposed system aims at automatic erythrocytes detection using ensemble of selected features of multiple convolution neural networks (CNNs) to overcome the shortcomings of existing works arising due to the highly overlapping characteristics of handcrafted features. The main merit of this work lies in the proposed two-stage feature selection algorithm, which completely eliminates the chances of information loss inherent in traditional CNNs, occurring due to the suppression of negative values of features by rectified linear unit (ReLU) and also largely reduces the feature dimensionality. Moreover, it is the first algorithm proposed, which is capable of selectively suppressing the positive or negative values or none of each feature depending upon its respective significance in classification, in contrary to the previously proposed variants of ReLU. Firstly, it constructs a feature space for each CNN by performing inter-selection among its Fully connected, ReLU and InverseReLU features and selecting features possessing minimum Fuzzy Entropy and maximum newly formulated Total Contribution Score values simultaneously. Secondly, it performs intra-selection within each selected feature space, eliminating less significant features which simultaneously satisfy the redundancy and non-relevancy criteria stated here. Finally, by performing detection using the feature-ensemble, this method registers 98.6% mAP, proving its excellence over existing works.

AB  - The microscopic inspection of blood samples provides qualitative and quantitative information about hematic pathologies. More precisely, the inspection of leucocytes (white blood cells) and their proportion of counts of the different types of leucocytes, known as differential counts, can assist hematologists in diagnosing diseases such as AIDS and leukemia. This study applies deep learning's convolutional neural network (CNN) for the image classification of four types of leucocytes, namely, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils. CNNs work through pattern recognition to detect significant features that help distinguish different classes. The CNN's hyperparameters were optimized through Genetic Algorithm (GA) and applied on a dataset containing 9,957 images and tested on another dataset of 2,478 images. The optimized CNN obtained a classification accuracy of 91% for the validation set and 99% for the training set, it also achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 97%, respectively. This study is proposed to substitute pathologists manually counting white blood cells in which it is a tiresome and monotonous procedure.

AB  - Red blood cell segmentation in microscopic images is the first step for various clinical studies carried out on blood samples such as cell counting, cell shape identification, etc. Conventional methods while often showing a high accuracy are heavily depending on the acquisition modality. Deep learning approaches have shown to be more robust regarding such modalities and still showing a comparable accuracy. In this paper, we first investigate necessary steps to apply a specific type of deep learning methods, namely fully convolutional networks, to red blood cell segmentation. Based on data given and constraints imposed by our partners mainly regarding a high throughput of their data we then describe an exemplary application. First results show, that even with a focus on high performance a good accuracy above 90% can be reached.

AB  - Background and objective: Leukocyte classification and cytometry have wide applications in medical domain, previous researches usually exploit machine learning techniques to classify leukocytes automatically. However, constrained by the past development of machine learning techniques, for example, extracting distinctive features from raw microscopic images are difficult, the widely used SVM classifier only has relative few parameters to tune, these methods cannot efficiently handle fine-grained classification cases when the white blood cells have up to 40 categories. Methods: Based on deep learning theory, a systematic study is conducted on finer leukocyte classification in this paper. A deep residual neural network based leukocyte classifier is constructed at first, which can imitate the domain expert’s cell recognition process, and extract salient features robustly and automatically. Then the deep neural network classifier’s topology is adjusted according to the prior knowledge of white blood cell test. After that the microscopic image dataset with almost one hundred thousand labeled leukocytes belonging to 40 categories is built, and combined training strategies are adopted to make the designed classifier has good generalization ability. Results: The proposed deep residual neural network based classifier was tested on microscopic image dataset with 40 leukocyte categories. It achieves top-1 accuracy of 77.80%, top-5 accuracy of 98.75% during the training procedure. The average accuracy on the test set is nearly 76.84%. Conclusions: This paper presents a fine-grained leukocyte classification method for microscopic images, based on deep residual learning theory and medical domain knowledge. Experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Extended experiments support that the fine-grained leukocyte classifier could be used in real medical applications, assist doctors in diagnosing diseases, reduce human power significantly.

AB  - Detection of sickle cell disease is a crucial job in medical image analysis. It emphasizes elaborate analysis of proper disease diagnosis after accurate detection followed by a classification of irregularities, which plays a vital role in the sickle cell disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and treatment outcome evaluation. Proper segmentation of complex cell clusters makes sickle cell detection more accurate and robust. Cell morphology has a key role in the detection of the sickle cell because the shapes of the normal blood cell and sickle cell differ significantly. This review emphasizes state-of-the-art methods and recent advances in detection, segmentation, and classification of sickle cell disease. We discuss key challenges encountered during the segmentation of overlapping blood cells. Moreover, standard validation measures that have been employed to yield performance analysis of various methods are also discussed. The methodologies and experiments in this review will be useful to further research and work in this area.

AB  - Leukemia is a fatal disease of white blood cells which affects the blood and bone marrow in human body. We deployed deep convolutional neural network for automated detection of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and classification of its subtypes into 4 classes, that is, L1, L2, L3, and Normal which were mostly neglected in previous literature. In contrary to the training from scratch, we deployed pretrained AlexNet which was fine-tuned on our data set. Last layers of the pretrained network were replaced with new layers which can classify the input images into 4 classes. To reduce overtraining, data augmentation technique was used. We also compared the data sets with different color models to check the performance over different color images. For acute lymphoblastic leukemia detection, we achieved a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 98.11%, and accuracy of 99.50%; and for acute lymphoblastic leukemia subtype classification the sensitivity was 96.74%, specificity was 99.03%, and accuracy was 96.06%. Unlike the standard methods, our proposed method was able to achieve high accuracy without any need of microscopic image segmentation.

AB  - To solve the problem of supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) models suffering from limited samples, a two-channel CNN is developed for medical hyperspectral images (MHSI) classification tasks. In the proposed network, one channel of end-to-end network, denoted as EtoE-Net, is designed to realize unsupervised learning, obtaining representative and global fused features with fewer noises, by building pixel-by-pixel mapping between the two source data, i.e., the original MHSI data and its principal component. On the other hand, a simple but efficient CNN is employed to supply local detailed information. The features extracted from different underlying layers of two channels (i.e., EtoE-Net and typical CNN) are concatenated into a vector, which is expected to preserve global and local informations simultaneously. Furthermore, the two-channel deep fusion network, named as EtoE-Fusion, is designed, where the full connection is employed for feature dimensionality reduction. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, experiments on two MHSI data sets are implemented, and results confirm the potentiality of the proposed method in MHSI classification.

AB  - The traditional process of the complete blood count test has long provided hematologists with information to diagnose blood-based disorders. However, this tedious and manual process can be subject to bias and inaccurate classifications. As a result, automated methods of white-blood cell detection and counting have been sought out as a means to facilitate the process and improve classification accuracy. In this paper, we present a new method, PatternNet-fused Ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks (PECNN) for classifying white blood cells. The proposed architecture relies on an ensemble method, PatternNet, to fuse outputs of n randomly generated Convolutional Neural Networks. The reliance on randomly generated structures allows the proposed algorithm to be adaptive to data, generalizing its applications. The PatternNet captures the strengths of each participating model while being insensitive to outliers. Through our experimental procedure, we were able to show that our ensemble model outperformed other ensemble models even in midst of noisy data. We were also able to show that the proposed architecture performs as well as a much more sophisticated deep network with a much less computational cost.

AB  - The necessary step in the diagnosis of leukemia by the attending physician is to classify the white blood cells in the bone marrow, which requires the attending physician to have a wealth of clinical experience. Now the deep learning is very suitable for the study of image recognition classification, and the effect is not good enough to directly use some famous convolution neural network (CNN) models, such as AlexNet model, GoogleNet model, and VGGFace model. In this paper, we construct a new CNN model called WBCNet model that can fully extract features of the microscopic white blood cell image by combining batch normalization algorithm, residual convolution architecture, and improved activation function. WBCNet model has 33 layers of network architecture, whose speed has greatly been improved compared with the traditional CNN model in training period, and it can quickly identify the category of white blood cell images. The accuracy rate is 77.65% for Top-1 and 98.65% for Top-5 on the training set, while 83% for Top-1 on the test set. This study can help doctors diagnose leukemia, and reduce misdiagnosis rate.

AB  - Accurate classification and counting of blood components is crucial in detection of illnesses of an individual. The widely used methods to count blood components are manual counting and hematology analyzer. With advancement in the field of image processing and machine learning, new and better methods are available for counting and classifying blood components. Deep leaning is training the computer with labelled data for classification tasks. Such techniques have shown high performance and accuracy. Most Deep learning models uses neural network architecture. One of the most popular type of deep learning model is Convolutional Neural Network. CNN convolves learned features with input data, and uses 2D convolutional layers, making this architecture well suited to processing 2D data, such as images. CNN's extract the features from the image automatically using numerous hidden layers. Most Deep learning models use transfer learning that is fine-tuning a pre-trained model. RCNN stands for Region based CNN. Unlike CNN which is used for image classification, RCNN is used for object detection. Thus in this paper, we have proposed a method to classify various components of blood : RBCs, WBCs (Monocyte, Lymphocytes, Eosinophils, Neutrophils and Basophils) and find their count from a microscopic blood image using Faster R-CNN model. Thus generating a CBC (Complete Blood Count) report which can be used by medical professionals to diagnose, suggest tests and treatments to their patients.

AB  - Examining blood microscopic images for leukemia is necessary when expensive equipment for flow cytometry is unavailable. Automated systems can ease the burden on medical experts for performing this examination and may be especially helpful to quickly screen a large number of patients. We present a simple, yet effective classification approach using a ResNeXt convolutional neural network with Squeeze-and-Excitation modules. The approach was evaluated in the C-NMC online challenge and achieves a weighted F1-score of 88.91 % on the test set. Code is available at https://github.com/jprellberg/isbi2019cancer.

AB  - Acute Leukemia is a life-threatening disease common both in children and adults that can lead to death if left untreated. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) spreads out in children's bodies rapidly and takes the life within a few weeks. To diagnose ALL, the hematologists perform blood and bone marrow examination. Manual blood testing techniques that have been used since long time are often slow and come out with the less accurate diagnosis. This work improves the diagnosis of ALL with a computer-aided system, which yields accurate result by using image processing and deep learning techniques. This research proposed a method for the classification of ALL into its subtypes and reactive bone marrow (normal) in stained bone marrow images. A robust segmentation and deep learning techniques with the convolutional neural network are used to train the model on the bone marrow images to achieve accurate classification results. Experimental results thus obtained and compared with the results of other classifiers Naïve Bayesian, KNN, and SVM. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method achieved 97.78% accuracy. The obtained results exhibit that the proposed approach could be used as a tool to diagnose Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and its sub-types that will definitely assist pathologists.

AB  - Background and objectives
Morphological analysis is the starting point for the diagnostic approach of more than 80% of hematological diseases. However, the morphological differentiation among different types of normal and abnormal peripheral blood cells is a difficult task that requires experience and skills. Therefore, the paper proposes a system for the automatic classification of eight groups of peripheral blood cells with high accuracy by means of a transfer learning approach using convolutional neural networks. With this new approach, it is not necessary to implement image segmentation, the feature extraction becomes automatic and existing models can be fine-tuned to obtain specific classifiers.
Methods
A dataset of 17,092 images of eight classes of normal peripheral blood cells was acquired using the CellaVision DM96 analyzer. All images were identified by pathologists as the ground truth to train a model to classify different cell types: neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, immature granulocytes (myelocytes, metamyelocytes and promyelocytes), erythroblasts and platelets. Two designs were performed based on two architectures of convolutional neural networks, Vgg-16 and Inceptionv3. In the first case, the networks were used as feature extractors and these features were used to train a support vector machine classifier. In the second case, the same networks were fine-tuned with our dataset to obtain two end-to-end models for classification of the eight classes of blood cells.
Results
In the first case, the experimental test accuracies obtained were 86% and 90% when extracting features with Vgg-16 and Inceptionv3, respectively. On the other hand, in the fine-tuning experiment, global accuracy values of 96% and 95% were obtained using Vgg-16 and Inceptionv3, respectively. All the models were trained and tested using Keras and Tensorflow with a Nvidia Titan XP Graphics Processing Unit.
Conclusions
The main contribution of this paper is a classification scheme involving a convolutional neural network trained to discriminate among eight classes of cells circulating in peripheral blood. Starting from a state-of-the-art general architecture, we have established a fine-tuning procedure to develop an end-to-end classifier trained using a dataset with over 17,000 cell images obtained from clinical practice. The performance obtained when testing the system has been truly satisfactory, the values of precision, sensitivity, and specificity being excellent. To summarize, the best overall classification accuracy has been 96.2%.

AB  - Cancer has been plaguing the society for a long time and still there is no certain treatment; especially if detected in later stages. That is why early detection and treatment of cancer is of utmost importance. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a type of blood cancer which is known to progress very rapidly and prove fatal if there is a delay in detection. Detection of this type of cancer is carried out manually by observing the blood samples of patient under microscope and conducting various other tests. This process may produce undesirable drawbacks: slowness, nonstandardized accuracy since it depends on examiner's / pathologist's capabilities and fatigue due to work overload can cause human errors in detection. A few automated systems for detection of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) have been proposed which involve extracting features from blood images using MATLAB and implementing different classifiers to produce results, which gave remarkable accuracies though not enough for practical usage. Our proposed system is further improving the classification accuracy. It uses openCV and skimage for image processing to extract relevant features from blood image and not just sheer number of features and further classification is carried out using various classifiers: CNN, FNN, SVM and KNN of which CNN gives the highest accuracy of 98.33%. CNN and FNN are written using TensorFlow framework. The accuracies obtained by other classifiers: FNN, SVM, and KNN are 95.40%, 91.40% and 93.30% respectively.

AB  - Automatic detection of leukemic B-lymphoblast cancer in microscopic images is very challenging due to the complicated nature of histopathological structures. To tackle this issue, an automatic and robust diagnostic system is required for early detection and treatment. In this paper, an automated deep learning-based method is proposed to distinguish between immature leukemic blasts and normal cells. The proposed deep learning based hybrid method, which is enriched by different data augmentation techniques, is able to extract high-level features from input images. Results demonstrate that the proposed model yields better prediction than individual models for Leukemic Blymphoblast classification with 96.17% overall accuracy, 95.17% sensitivity and 98.58% specificity. Fusing the features extracted from intermediate layers, our approach has the potential to improve the overall classification performance.

AB  - Multiple myeloma is a haematological cancer that occurs in plasma cells. The increase in the myeloma cells induces the reduction in all the blood cells. This paper presents the computer-aided methodology for multiple myeloma detection and diagnosis. Convolutional neural network is employed in order to detect multiple myeloma while using microscopic images of blood. Pre- trained and fine- tuned AlexNet is used for diagnosis of myeloma. Microscopic images are classified into normal and blast using AlexNet as feature extractor and SVM for classification. Proposed methodology is compared with state-of-the art in literature and the presented technique outperforms the previous methodologies.

AB  - Image analysis based automated systems aiming to automate the manual microscopic review of peripheral blood smears have gained popularity in recent times. In this paper, we evaluate a new blood smear analysis system based on artificial intelligence, Shonit™ by SigTuple Technologies Private Limited. One hundred normal samples with no flags from an automated haematology analyser were taken. Peripheral blood smear slides were prepared using the autostainer integrated with an automated haematology analyser and stained using May-Grunwald–Giemsa stain. These slides were analysed with Shonit™. The metrics for evaluation included (1) accuracy of white blood cell classification for the five normal white blood cell types, and (2) comparison of white blood cell differential count with the automated haematology analyser. In addition, we also explored the possibility of estimating the value of red blood cell and platelet indices via image analysis. Overall white blood cell classification specificity was greater than 97.90% and the precision was greater than 93.90% for all the five white blood cell classes. The correlation of the white blood cell differential count between the automated haematology analyser and Shonit™ was found to be within the known inter cell-counter variability. Shonit™ was found to show promise in terms of its ability to analyse peripheral blood smear images to derive quantifiable metrics useful for clinicians. Future enhancement should include the ability to analyse abnormal blood samples.

AB  - White blood cells (WBC) play a significant role in human immune system, so WBC detection is a meaningful work. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which combines Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) and SO-you only look once (YOLO) for WCB detection. FPM is a recently developed microscope technology which can achieve high-resolution, wide-field, and quantitative phase imaging at the same time without mechanical moving and phase measurement. With the FPM, we can get high resolution, wide field-of-view blood cell images at one time. After obtaining high-resolution images, we propose SO-YOLO as our detection method. As a convolutional neural network, the SO-YOLO outperforms the state-of-the-art detection methods both in accuracy and speed. The proposed framework in this paper can be used in clinical diagnose, because the experiment setup is flexible and the detection is fast. The data set in this paper is made with FPM by ourselves. Our data set contains 1000 color high resolution images and all the WBC has been detected and counted by a human expert. The detection results by the experts are regarded as the ground truth. The experiment results show that the SO-YOLO performs well in detecting small objects compared with other methods.

AB  - Classification is widely used in medical images to categorize patients and non-patients. However, conventional classification requires a complex procedure, including some rigid steps such as pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, detection, and classification. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN), called LeukemiaNet, to specifically classify two different types of leukemia, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and non-cancerous patients. To extend the limited dataset, a PCA color augmentation process is utilized before images are input into the LeukemiaNet. This augmentation method enhances the accuracy of our proposed CNN architecture from 96.9% to 97.2% for distinguishing ALL, AML, and normal cell images.

In this study, we use light microscopy and deep learning-based image analysis to classify the morphological changes of macrophages infected by Mycobacterium marinum (Mm), a surrogate model for Mtb. Macrophages were infected either with the mCherry-expressing Mm wild type strain (Mm(WT)), or a mutant strain with deletion of the esxA-esxB operon (Mm(ΔEsxA:B)). The mCherry serves as an infection marker to train the convolution neural network (CNN) and to validate the classification results. Data show that CNN can distinguish the Mm(WT)-infected cells from uninfected cells with an accuracy of 92.4% at 2 hours post infection (hpi). However, the accuracy at 12 and 24 hpi is decreased to ~75% and ~83%, respectively, suggesting dynamic morphological changes through different stages of infection. The accuracy of discriminating Mm(ΔEsxA:B)-infected cells from uninfected cells is lower than 80% at all time, which is consistent to attenuated virulence of Mm(ΔEsxA:B). Interestingly, CNN distinguishes Mm(WT)-infected cells from Mm(ΔEsxA:B)-infected cells with Δ90% accuracy, implicating EsxA induces unique morphological changes in macrophages. Deconvolutional analysis successfully reconstructed the morphological features used by CNN for classification, which are indistinguishable to naked eyes and distinct from intracellular mycobacteria. This study presents a deep learning-aided imaging analytical tool that can accurately detect virulent mycobacteria-infected macrophages by cellular morphological changes. The observed morphological changes induced by EsxA warrant further studies to fill the gap from molecular actions of bacterial virulence factors to cellular morphology., Mycobacterium tuberlucosis (Mtb) is an intracellular pathogenic bacteria that poses a serious threat to public health. Detection of Mtb infection plays an important role in tuberlucosis (TB) diagnosis, prevention and treatment. Here, a deep learning neural network for image analysis is developed to detect mycobacterial infection in unstained macrophages by solely recognizing morphological changes. The trained convolutional neural network (CNN) can accurately distinguish infected cells from uninfected cells using regular phase-contrast microscopic images. Moreover, the CNN could further distinguish the infections caused by wild type virulent mycobacterial strain versus a mutant strain with deletion of virulence factors, which correlates virulence factors to specific morphological features and demonstrates potential applications in TB diagnosis and research.

T2  - IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering
AB  - Digital pathology and microscopy image analysis is widely used for comprehensive studies of cell morphology or tissue structure. Manual assessment is labor intensive and prone to interobserver variations. Computer-aided methods, which can significantly improve the objectivity and reproducibility, have attracted a great deal of interest in recent literature. Among the pipeline of building a computer-aided diagnosis system, nucleus or cell detection and segmentation play a very important role to describe the molecular morphological information. In the past few decades, many efforts have been devoted to automated nucleus/cell detection and segmentation. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the recent state-of-the-art nucleus/cell segmentation approaches on different types of microscopy images including bright-field, phase-contrast, differential interference contrast, fluorescence, and electron microscopies. In addition, we discuss the challenges for the current methods and the potential future work of nucleus/cell detection and segmentation.

AB  - Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a serious hematological disorder, where affected patients are frequently hospitalized throughout a lifetime and even can cause death. The manual method of detecting and classifying abnormal cells of SCA patient blood film through a microscope is time-consuming, tedious, prone to error, and require a trained hematologist. The affected patient has many cell shapes that show important biomechanical characteristics. Hence, having an effective way of classifying the abnormalities present in the SCA disease will give a better insight into managing the concerned patient's life. This work proposed algorithm in two-phase firstly, automation of red blood cells (RBCs) extraction to identify the RBC region of interest (ROI) from the patient’s blood smear image. Secondly, deep learning AlexNet model is employed to classify and predict the abnormalities presence in SCA patients. The study was performed with (over 9,000 single RBC images) taken from 130 SCA patient each class having 750 cells. To develop a shape factor quantification and general multiscale shape analysis. We reveal that the proposed framework can classify 15 types of RBC shapes including normal in an automated manner with a deep AlexNet transfer learning model. The cell's name classification prediction accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of 95.92%, 77%, 98.82%, and 90% were achieved, respectively.

AB  - Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a disease that is defined by uncontrollable growth of malignant and immature White Blood Cells (WBCs) which is called lymphoblast. Traditionally, lymphoblast analysis is done manually and highly dependent on the pathologist’s skill and  experience which sometimes yields inaccurate result. For that reason, in this project an algorithm to automatically detect WBC and subsequently examine ALL disease using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed. Several pretrained CNN models which are VGG, GoogleNet and Alexnet were analaysed to compare its performance for differentiating lymphoblast and non-lymphoblast cells from IDB database. The tuning is done by experimenting the convolution layer, pooling layer and fully connected layer. Technically, 70% of the images are used for training and another 30% for testing. From the experiments, it is found that the best pretrained models are VGG and GoogleNet compared to AlexNet by achieving 100% accuracy for training. As for testing, VGG obtained the highest performance which is 99.13% accuracy. Apart from that, VGG also proven to have better result based on the training graph which is more stable and contains less error compared to the other two models.

					Leukemia is a disorder that affects the bone marrow, causing uncontrolled production of leukocytes, impairing the transport of oxygen and causing blood coagulation problems. In this article, we propose a new computational tool, named LeukNet, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture based on the VGG-16 convolutional blocks, to facilitate the leukemia diagnosis from blood smear images. We evaluated different architectures and fine-tuning methods using 18 datasets containing 3536 images with distinct characteristics of color, texture, contrast, and resolution. Additionally, data augmentation operations were applied to increase the training set by up to 20 times. The k-fold cross-validation (k = 5) results achieved 98.28% of accuracy. A cross-dataset validation technique, named LeaveOne-Dataset-Out Cross-Validation (LODOCV), is also proposed to evaluate the developed model’s generalization capability. The accuracy of using LODOCV on the ALL-IDB 1, ALL-IDB 2, and UFG datasets was 97.04%, 82.46%, and 70.24%, respectively, overcoming the current state-of-the-art results and offering new guidelines for image-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems in this area.

AB  - Introduction Several studies have provided evidence of the key role of neutrophils in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, no study to date has investigated the potential link between AD and morphologically abnormal neutrophils on blood smears. Methods Due to the complexity and subjectivity of the task by human analysis, deep learning models were trained to predict AD from neutrophil images. Control models were trained for a known feasible task (leukocyte subtype classification) and for detecting potential biases of overfitting (patient prediction). Results Deep learning models achieved state-of-the-art results for leukocyte subtype classification but could not accurately predict AD. Discussion We found no evidence of morphological abnormalities of neutrophils in AD. Our results show that a solid deep learning pipeline with positive and bias control models with visualization techniques are helpful to support deep learning model results.

AB  - White blood cells (WBCs) play a main role in identifying the health condition and disease characteristics of a normal person. An automated classification system is capable of recognizing white blood cells that may help doctors to diagnose several diseases like malaria, anemia, leukemia, etc. Automated blood cell analysis allows fast and accurate outcomes and often involves broad data without performance negotiation. The state-of-the-art systems use a lot of different stages (feature extraction, segmentation, pre-processing, etc.) to provide the automated blood cell analysis using blood smear images which is a lengthy process. To overcome these problems, this paper presents an efficient peripheral blood cell image recognition and classification using a combination of the salp swarm algorithm and the cat swarm optimization (SSPSO) algorithm-based optimized convolutional neural networks (SSPSO-CNN) method. This paper uses the CNN approach to classify five peripheral blood cells such as eosinophil, basophil, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils without any human intervention. The other objective of this paper is to propose an improved version of salp swarm optimizer (SSO) using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to attain competitive classification performance over the database of the blood cell images. In this paper, the CNN uses VGG19 architecture for training purposes. The accuracy of the classification achieved with VGG19 models is 98%. The proposed model based on the CNN approach optimized by SSPSO achieves high classification accuracy and provides automatic peripheral blood cell classification. This method establishes the fine-tuning process to develop a classifier trained using 10 674 images obtained from medical practice. The proposed method augmented the performance in terms of high precision and FF<math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"><mi>F</mi></math>1-score and obtained an overall classification accuracy of 99%.

T2  - Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics
AB  - Background
While the number and structural features of white blood cells (WBC) can provide important information about the health status of human beings, the ratio of sub-types of these cells and the deformations that can be observed serve as a good indicator in the diagnosis process of some diseases. Hence, correct identification and classification of the WBC types is of great importance. In addition, the fact that the diagnostic process that is carried out manually is slow, and the success is directly proportional to the expert's skills makes this problem an excellent field of application for computer-aided diagnostic systems. Unfortunately, both the ethical reasons and the cost of image acquisition process is one of the biggest obstacles to the fact that researchers working with medical images are able to collect enough data to produce a stable model. For that reasons, researchers who want to perform a successful analysis with small data sets using classical machine learning methods need to undergo their data a long and error-prone pre-process, while those using deep learning methods need to increase the data size using augmentation techniques. As a result, there is a need for a model that does not need pre-processing and can perform a successful classification in small data sets.
Methods
WBCs were classified under five categories using a small data set via capsule networks, a new deep learning method. We improved the model using many techniques and compared the results with the most known deep learning methods.
Results
Both the above-mentioned problems were overcame and higher success rates were obtained compared to other deep learning models. While, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning (TL) models suffered from over-fitting, capsule networks learned well training data and achieved a high accuracy on test data (96.86%).
Conclusion
In this study, we briefly discussed the abilities of capsule networks in a case study. We showed that capsule networks are a quite successful alternative for deep learning and medical data analysis when the sample size is limited.

AB  - Blood and its components play a very important role in human life and it considers the best indicator in determining many biological conditions. Pathologists used optical microscopic blood images to diagnose diseases; some of these diseases are Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), Leukemia, after recognizing white blood cells (WBCs) from those images. Recently, a Computer-aided diagnosis system is used for diagnosing blood from its microscopic images. In this research, microscopic WBCs images were classified using a hybrid system where Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used as features extractor and different machine learning algorithms used as classifiers, then the performances of these classifiers were evaluated to recognize the best of them. These algorithms include Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest, for training and test parameters we used five features that were extracted from the images. According to results of performance, the RF performed better than the other methods with a testing accuracy reached 98.7%.

AB  - Purpose
To evaluate the efficacy of diagnosis systems based upon instance segmentation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for diagnosing acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in bone marrow smear images.
Materials and methods
A self-established dataset was used in this study that was exempted from review by the institution review board, which consisted of 13,504 bone marrow smear images. One subset of the dataset with 12,215 labeled images was split into training (80%) and validation (20%), another with 1289 labeled images was used to test, in which each test entry consists of about 130 images. An instance segmentation method named Mask R-CNN was used to detect and classify the nucleated cells. Here, we train a trained neural network from scratch; for comparison, we also use a network pre-trained on MS COCO (common objects in context, a data set provided by Microsoft which can be used for image recognition, the images in MS coco dataset are divided into training, validation and test sets) and fine-tuned with our dataset and both were trained with same data augmentation scheme. Diagnosis systems based on trained models and “FAB Classification” (French–American–British classification systems, a series of diagnostic criteria for acute leukemia, which was first proposed in 1976) were developed for diagnosing the test entry as APL or as not. Average precision (AP) and average recall (AR) were used to evaluate model performance.
Results
The best-performing model had an average precision of 62.5%, which was the augmented pre-trained Mask R-CNN with average recall 84.1%. The average precision of the pre-trained model was greater than that of the model trained from scratch (P < 0.05). Augmenting the dataset further increased accuracy (P < 0 0.03).
Conclusion
Deep learning technology such as instance segmentation with Mask R-CNN may accurately diagnose APL in bone marrow smear images with an average precision of 62.5% when 0.5 as IoU thresholds. A data augmentation and pre-trained approach further improved accuracy.

AB  - Leukemia is a cancer of blood cells in the bone marrow that affects both children and adolescents. The rapid growth of unusual lymphocyte cells leads to bone marrow failure, which may slow down the production of new blood cells, and hence increases patient morbidity and mortality. Age is a crucial clinical factor in leukemia diagnosis, since if leukemia is diagnosed in the early stages, it is highly curable. Incidence is increasing globally, as around 412,000 people worldwide are likely to be diagnosed with some type of leukemia, of which acute lymphoblastic leukemia accounts for approximately 12% of all leukemia cases worldwide. Thus, the reliable and accurate detection of normal and malignant cells is of major interest. Automatic detection with computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) models can assist medics, and can be beneficial for the early detection of leukemia. In this paper, a single center study, we aimed to build an aggregated deep learning model for Leukemic B-lymphoblast classification. To make a reliable and accurate deep learner, data augmentation techniques were applied to tackle the limited dataset size, and a transfer learning strategy was employed to accelerate the learning process, and further improve the performance of the proposed network. The results show that our proposed approach was able to fuse features extracted from the best deep learning models, and outperformed individual networks with a test accuracy of 96.58% in Leukemic B-lymphoblast diagnosis.

AB  - Classification of leukocytes into morphological classes is one of the main steps in the effective recognition of cancerous white blood cells and the diagnosis of malignancies. Before the evolution of computer-aided system designs, the process of morphological classification and inspection of microscopic blood smears is carried out by qualified and proficient human examiners which makes the procedure inefficient and slow. In this paper, a computer-aided classification technique is presented which is based on a combination of image processing and deep learning approaches to classify blood smears into its discrete morphological classes. The proposed methodology includes the conversion of blood images to L*a*b color space from RGB, K-mean clustering for segmentation, and deep convolutional networks for classification. Transfer learning is employed to shift the learned knowledge of pre-trained networks including AlexNet and ResNet18. Statistical evaluation parameters are used to validate the performance of the system on the Munich AML Morphological dataset. The results show reliable classification accuracy of 93.30% and 93.85% for AlexNet and ResNet18 respectively. The classification approach discussed in this paper can be used in real-time clinical environments as it is trained on a large dataset it allows detection in an earlier stage of the disease.

AB  - For the last few years, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been increasing rapidly. Numerous machine learning algorithms have been developed to identify different diseases, e.g., leukemia. Leukemia is a white blood cells- (WBC-) related illness affecting the bone marrow and/or blood. A quick, safe, and accurate early-stage diagnosis of leukemia plays a key role in curing and saving patients’ lives. Based on developments, leukemia consists of two primary forms, i.e., acute and chronic leukemia. Each form can be subcategorized as myeloid and lymphoid. There are, therefore, four leukemia subtypes. Various approaches have been developed to identify leukemia with respect to its subtypes. However, in terms of effectiveness, learning process, and performance, these methods require improvements. This study provides an Internet of Medical Things- (IoMT-) based framework to enhance and provide a quick and safe identification of leukemia. In the proposed IoMT system, with the help of cloud computing, clinical gadgets are linked to network resources. The system allows real-time coordination for testing, diagnosis, and treatment of leukemia among patients and healthcare professionals, which may save both time and efforts of patients and clinicians. Moreover, the presented framework is also helpful for resolving the problems of patients with critical condition in pandemics such as COVID-19. The methods used for the identification of leukemia subtypes in the suggested framework are Dense Convolutional Neural Network (DenseNet-121) and Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet-34). Two publicly available datasets for leukemia, i.e., ALL-IDB and ASH image bank, are used in this study. The results demonstrated that the suggested models supersede the other well-known machine learning algorithms used for healthy-versus-leukemia-subtypes identification.

T2  - Medical Hypotheses
AB  - White blood cells (WBC) are important parts of our immune system and they protect our body against infections by eliminating viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi. There are five types of WBC. These are called Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils and Neutrophils. The number of WBC types and the total number of WBCs provide important information about our health status. Diseases such as leukemia, AIDS, autoimmune diseases, immune deficiencies, blood diseases can be diagnosed based on the number of WBCs. In this study, a computer-aided automated system that can easily identify and locate WBC types in blood images has been proposed. Current blood test devices usually detect WBCs with traditional image processing methods such as preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. Deep learning methodology is superior to traditional image processing methods in literature. In addition, traditional methods require the appearance of the whole object to be able to recognize objects. Contrary to traditional methods, convolutional neural networks (CNN), a deep learning architecture, can extract features from a part of an object and perform object recognition. In this case, a CNN-based system shows a higher performance in recognizing partially visible cells for reasons such as overlap or only partial visibility of the image. Therefore, it has been the motivation of this study to increase the performance of existing blood test devices with deep learning method. Blood cells have been identified and classified by Regional Based Convolutional Neural Networks. Designed architectures have been trained and tested by combining BCCD data set and LISC data set. Regional Convolutional Neural Networks (R – CNN) has been used as a methodology. In this way, different cell types within the same image have been classified simultaneously with a detector. While training CNN which is the basis of R – CNN architecture; AlexNet, VGG16, GoogLeNet, ResNet50 architectures have been tested with full learning and transfer learning. At the end of the study, the system has showed 100% success in determining WBC cells. ResNet50, one of the CNN architectures, has showed the best performance with transfer learning. Cell types of Lymphocyte were determined with 99.52% accuracy rate, Monocyte with 98.40% accuracy rate, Basophil with 98.48% accuracy rate, Eosinophil with 96.16% accuracy rate and Neutrophil with 95.04% accuracy rate.

T2  - Mobile Networks and Applications
AB  - White blood cells (Leukocytes) are considered to be an essential part of the human body’s immune system. The count of WBCs is considered to be a parameter for the indication of disease. Over time several methods have been proposed to classify these WBCs into their subtypes namely Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Basophils, Lymphocytes, and Monocytes which helps in the estimation of the body’s WBC count. These methods range from various morphological image processing-based methodologies to advanced deep neural systems. Due to the superior ability of neural systems to achieve the state of the art results more research is been carried out in this field. However, most of the such previously proposed methods have concentrated only in establishing and explaining the overall methodology for achieving high accuracy scores and less emphasis has been made in discussing the impact of modular changes in such methodologies like the impact of various activation functions, optimizers and data pre-processing methods very explicitly for this problem. This has led to a deficiency of work to be carried out with very recently developed activation functions and more essentially optimization algorithms other than backpropagation. It is extremely essential to explore and analyse different modules of the methodology to accelerate future research work further which might possibly help the research community in achieving a much better and efficient solution. This paper compares various architectures and discusses the behaviour and impact of different hyperparameters and proposes a novel methodology by incorporating recently developed swish activation to enhance the results. Unlike previously proposed methods of proposing single better neural network model this paper suggests a good choice of modular changes that could be incorporated in future works to enhance their results.

AU  - Sahlol, Ahmed T.

T2  - Scientific Reports
AB  - White Blood Cell (WBC) Leukaemia is caused by excessive production of leukocytes in the bone marrow, and image-based detection of malignant WBCs is important for its detection. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) present the current state-of-the-art for this type of image classification, but their computational cost for training and deployment can be high. We here present an improved hybrid approach for efficient classification of WBC Leukemia. We first extract features from WBC images using VGGNet, a powerful CNN architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet. The extracted features are then filtered using a statistically enhanced Salp Swarm Algorithm (SESSA). This bio-inspired optimization algorithm selects the most relevant features and removes highly correlated and noisy features. We applied the proposed approach to two public WBC Leukemia reference datasets and achieve both high accuracy and reduced computational complexity. The SESSA optimization selected only 1 K out of 25 K features extracted with VGGNet, while improving accuracy at the same time. The results are among the best achieved on these datasets and outperform several convolutional network models. We expect that the combination of CNN feature extraction and SESSA feature optimization could be useful for many other image classification tasks.

AB  - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a condition that occurs in the bone marrow. Most cases of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) develop from cells that would turn into white blood cells (other than lymphocytes), but some cases of ALL develop in blood-forming cells of various kinds. Anything begins in the bone marrow (the soft inner part of some bones, where new blood cells are made), yet it moves rapidly into the blood by and large. It may spread to various parts of the body once in a while, including the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, central nervous system (cerebrum and spinal cord), and testicles. The traditional method used by doctors to detect ALL is tedious and time consuming. It consists of several methods such as blood testing, aspiration and biopsy to the bone marrow, image testing using CT scanning and MRI. These methods take time and are expensive. The proposed approach uses imaging processing techniques to detect irregular blood cells in the microscopic images of the blood. Using the training data collection, the program is trained using DCNN and is uploaded into HDFS Hadoop framework. The learned method classifies when a new image is inserted into the program whether the collected picture includes cancerous leukemia cells or irregular cells. This way the process of detection of leukemia is automated and can be accessed by any of the hospitals with connected to the cloud system.

AU  - Baydilli, Yusuf Yargı

AU  - Elen, Abdullah
T2  - Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine
AB  - Background and objective: Traditional machine learning methods assume that both training and test data come from the same distribution. In this way, it becomes possible to achieve high successes when modelling on the same domain. Unfortunately, in real-world problems, direct transfer between domains is adversely affected due to differences in the data collection process and the internal dynamics of the data. In order to cope with such drawbacks, researchers use a method called “domain adaptation”, which enables the successful transfer of information learned in one domain to other domains. In this study, a model that can be used in the classification of white blood cells (WBC) and is not affected by domain differences was proposed. Methods: Only one data set was used as source domain, and an adaptation process was created that made possible the learned knowledge to be used effectively in other domains (multi-target domain adaptation). While constructing the model, we employed data augmentation, data generation and fine-tuning processes, respectively. Results: The proposed model has been able to extract “domain-invariant” features and achieved high success rates in the tests performed on nine different data sets. Multi-target domain adaptation accuracy was measured as %98.09. Conclusions: At the end of the study, it has been observed that the proposed model ignores the domain differences and it can adapt in a successful way to target domains. In this way, it becomes possible to classify unlabeled samples rapidly by using only a few number of labeled ones.

AB  - Leukemia is a fatal disease that threatens the lives of many patients. Early detection can effectively improve its rate of remission. This paper proposes two automated classification models based on blood microscopic images to detect leukemia by employing transfer learning, rather than traditional approaches that have several disadvantages. In the first model, blood microscopic images are pre-processed; then, features are extracted by a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network named AlexNet, which makes classifications according to numerous well-known classifiers. In the second model, after pre-processing the images, AlexNet is fine-tuned for both feature extraction and classification. Experiments were conducted on a dataset consisting of 2820 images confirming that the second model performs better than the first because of 100% classification accuracy.

AB  - Malaria is an endemic life-threating disease caused by the unicellular protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Confirming the presence of parasites early in all malaria cases ensures species-specific antimalarial treatment, reducing the mortality rate, and points to other illnesses in negative cases. However, the gold standard remains the light microscopy of May-Gr&uuml;nwald&ndash;Giemsa (MGG)-stained thin and thick peripheral blood (PB) films. This is a time-consuming procedure, dependent on a pathologist&rsquo;s skills, meaning that healthcare providers may encounter difficulty in diagnosing malaria in places where it is not endemic. This work presents a novel three-stage pipeline to (1) segment erythrocytes, (2) crop and mask them, and (3) classify them into malaria infected or not. The first and third steps involved the design, training, validation and testing of a Segmentation Neural Network and a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch using a Graphic Processing Unit. Segmentation achieved a global accuracy of 93.72% over the test set and the specificity for malaria detection in red blood cells (RBCs) was 87.04%. This work shows the potential that deep learning has in the digital pathology field and opens the way for future improvements, as well as for broadening the use of the created networks.

AB  - Red Blood Corpuscles called Erythrocytes are the most important element in blood composition which is mainly responsible in all living cells. To detect the cancer cell various methods are employed. In this paper, proper identification of cancer cells from unaffected RBCs are detected. The proposed novel method called Online Region Based Segmentation (ORBS) method is done that is used to find the regions of corpuscles. By using properties, metric is formulated for determination of shape which is abnormal in blood cells. Overall accuracy of 96.9% is obtained using proposed ORBS method and deep learning classification (DLC) method has accuracy of 97.1% that helps to diagnose cancer cells using feature extraction process done automatically. Sensitivity, specificity and precision values of the proposed segmentation method is found to be 96.7%, 95.6% and 98.4% respectively. The computation time was found as 22 seconds. Closeness of Proposed method in relative to True Positive values at the ROC curve indicates the performance as higher. Comparative analysis is made with ResNet-50 based on the different testing and training data at rate of 90%−10%, 80%−20% and 70%−30% respectively, which proves the robustness of proposed research work. Experimental results prove proposed system effectiveness compared with other detection methods.

AB  - This review covers original articles using deep learning in the biophotonic field published in the last years. In these years deep learning, which is a subset of machine learning mostly based on artificial neural network geometries, was applied to a number of biophotonic tasks and has achieved state-of-the-art performances. Therefore, deep learning in the biophotonic field is rapidly growing and it will be utilized in the next years to obtain real-time biophotonic decision-making systems and to analyze biophotonic data in general. In this contribution, we discuss the possibilities of deep learning in the biophotonic field including image classification, segmentation, registration, pseudostaining and resolution enhancement. Additionally, we discuss the potential use of deep learning for spectroscopic data including spectral data preprocessing and spectral classification. We conclude this review by addressing the potential applications and challenges of using deep learning for biophotonic data.

AB  - In the process of kidney disease diagnosis, it is particularly important to screen the morphology of erythrocytes in urine. Because of the small and similar morphology of erythrocytes in urine, manual labeling and observation is time-consuming and labor-consuming. Deep learning can not only quickly and accurately locate urine erythrocytes, but also effectively identify the types of cells. In this paper, we employ the Faster RCNN combined with VggNet to detect urine erythrocytes. We collected images of urine erythrocytes under optical microscope and used data enhancement method to obtain total 3969 images of urine erythrocytes, which filled in the blank of domestic urine erythrocytes data sets. Experimental results show that the presented method can identify five kinds of urine erythrocytes and the recall rate achieve up to 99.8%, which greatly helped doctors better identify and judge urine erythrocytes.

AB  - Sickle cell anemia, which is also called sickle cell disease (SCD), is a hematological disorder that causes occlusion in blood vessels, leading to hurtful episodes and even death. The key function of red blood cells (erythrocytes) is to supply all the parts of the human body with oxygen. Red blood cells (RBCs) form a crescent or sickle shape when sickle cell anemia affects them. This abnormal shape makes it difficult for sickle cells to move through the bloodstream, hence decreasing the oxygen flow. The precise classification of RBCs is the first step toward accurate diagnosis, which aids in evaluating the danger level of sickle cell anemia. The manual classification methods of erythrocytes require immense time, and it is possible that errors may be made throughout the classification stage. Traditional computer-aided techniques, which have been employed for erythrocyte classification, are based on handcrafted features techniques, and their performance relies on the selected features. They also are very sensitive to different sizes, colors, and complex shapes. However, microscopy images of erythrocytes are very complex in shape with different sizes. To this end, this research proposes lightweight deep learning models that classify the erythrocytes into three classes: circular (normal), elongated (sickle cells), and other blood content. These models are different in the number of layers and learnable filters. The available datasets of red blood cells with sickle cell disease are very small for training deep learning models. Therefore, addressing the lack of training data is the main aim of this paper. To tackle this issue and optimize the performance, the transfer learning technique is utilized. Transfer learning does not significantly affect performance on medical image tasks when the source domain is completely different from the target domain. In some cases, it can degrade the performance. Hence, we have applied the same domain transfer learning, unlike other methods that used the ImageNet dataset for transfer learning. To minimize the overfitting effect, we have utilized several data augmentation techniques. Our model obtained state-of-the-art performance and outperformed the latest methods by achieving an accuracy of 99.54% with our model and 99.98% with our model plus a multiclass SVM classifier on the erythrocytesIDB dataset and 98.87% on the collected dataset.

AB  - Background Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been widely used in the classification of white blood cells (WBCs). However, the performance of ML algorithms still needs to be addressed for being short of gold standard data sets, and even the implementation of the proposed algorithms. Methods In this study, the method of two-module weighted optimized deformable convolutional neural networks (TWO-DCNN) was proposed for WBC classification. Our algorithm is characterized as two-module transfer learning and deformable convolutional (DC) layers for the betterment of robustness. To validate the performance, our method was compared with classical MLs of VGG16, VGG19, Inception-V3, ResNet-50, support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision tree (DT) and random forest (RF) on our undisclosed WBC data set and public BCCD data set. Results TWO-DCNN achieved the best performance with the precisions (PREs) of 95.7%, 94.5% and 91.6%, recalls (RECs) of 95.7%, 94.5% and 91.6%, F1-scores (F1s) of 95.7%, 94.5% and 91.6%, area under curves (AUCs) of 0.98, 0.97 and 0.95 for low-resolution and noisy undisclosed data sets, BCCD data set, respectively. Conclusions With accurate feature extraction and optimized network weights, the proposed TWO-DCNN showed the best performance in WBC classification for low-resolution and noisy data sets. It could be used as an alternative method for clinical applications.

AB  - Leukemia diagnosis based on bone marrow cell morphology primarily relies on the manual microscopy of bone marrow smears. However, this method is greatly affected by subjective factors and tends to lead to misdiagnosis. This study proposes using bone marrow cell microscopy images and employs convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with transfer learning to establish an objective, rapid, and accurate method for classification and diagnosis of LKA (AML, ALL, and CML). We collected cell microscopy images of 104 bone marrow smears (including 18 healthy subjects, 53 AML patients, 23 ALL patients, and 18 CML patients). The perfect reflection algorithm and a self-adaptive filter algorithm were first used for preprocessing of bone marrow cell images collected from experiments. Subsequently, 3 CNN frameworks (Inception-V3, ResNet50, and DenseNet121) were used to construct classification models for the raw dataset and preprocessed dataset. Transfer learning was used to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. Results showed that the DenseNet121 model based on the preprocessed dataset provided the best classification results, with a prediction accuracy of 74.8%. The prediction accuracy of the DenseNet121 model that was obtained by transfer learning optimization was 95.3%, which was increased by 20.5%. In this model, the prediction accuracies of the normal groups, AML, ALL, and CML were 90%, 99%, 97%, and 95%, respectively. The results showed that the leukemic cell morphology classification and diagnosis based on CNN combined with transfer learning is feasible. Compared with conventional manual microscopy, this method is more rapid, accurate, and objective.

AB  - Blood cell count plays an important role in the field of clinical medical diagnosis. To effectively automate the counting of blood cells, recently, the deep-learning-based detection method represented by the YOLO has been proposed and used successfully. Nevertheless, the YOLO detection method has difficulties in insufficient positioning of the bounding boxes and in distinguishing overlapping objects. To overcome the limitations, we propose a new deep-learning-based method, termed Attention-YOLO, which is achieved by adding the channel attention mechanism and the spatial attention mechanism to the feature extraction network. By using the filtered and weighted feature vector to replace the original feature vector for residual fusion, Attention-YOLO can help the network to improve the detection accuracy. The experimental results indicate that compared to the standard YOLO network, the Attention-YOLO can achieve a better detection performance in blood cell count without introducing too many additional parameters, where the recognition accuracy of cells (RBCs, WBCs, and platelets) has an improvement of 6.70%, 2.13%, and 10.44%, respectively, and the mean Average Precision (mAP) has an improvement of 7.10%.

AB  - White blood cells are cells in the blood and lymph tissue produced by the bone marrow in the human body. White blood cells are an important part of the immune system. The most important task of these cells is to protect the human body against foreign invaders and infectious diseases. When the number of white blood cells in the blood is not enough for the human body, it can cause leukopenia. As a result of this situation, the resistance of the human body against infections and diseases decreases. In this respect, determining the number of these cells in the human body is a specialist task. Detection and treatment of this symptom is a labor-intensive process carried out by specialist doctors and radiologists. Image processing techniques have recently been widely used in biomedical systems for the diagnosis of various diseases. In this study, it is aimed to use image processing techniques to improve the classification performance of deep learning models in white blood cells classification. To perform the classification process more efficiently, the Maximal Information Coefficient and Ridge feature selection methods were used in conjunction with the Convolutional Neural Network models. The Maximal Information Coefficient and Ridge feature selection methods extracted the most relevant features. Afterward, the classification process was realized by using this feature set. In this study, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet-50 were used as feature extractor and quadratic discriminant analysis was used as a classifier. As a result, the overall success rate was obtained as 97.95% in the classification of white blood cells. The experimental results showed that the use of the convolutional neural network models with feature selection methods contributed to improving the classification success of white blood cell types.

AB  - In this study, the researchers developed a cost-effective way of performing Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Differential Blood Count (DBC) by implementing image processing, analysis, and machine learning algorithms using a Raspberry pi B+ microcontroller in conjunction with a microscope that has Short Message Service (SMS) feature to be used in rural areas for remote transmission of results to a health professional. Blood image input from the raspberry pi's camera will be used for the counting and classification needed by the system. The capturing and analysis of the images will be integrated on a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide user-friendly access. HSV color space conversion, thresholding, morphological operations, and Connected Component Labeling (CCL) are used for CBC. For DBC, an additional process of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification is done. The study shows a remarkable result by having no significant difference from conventional method which is manual counting.

AB  - Leukemia is brought about by the quick generation of unusual white platelets. The high number of strange white platelets are not ready to battle contamination, and they impede the capacity of the bone marrow to create red platelets and platelets. Machine Learning techniques are widely used in the diagnosis and classification of different leukemia types in the patients. In this paper, we have described the different machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbour, Neural Networks, Naïve Bayes and Deep Learning algorithms which are used to classify leukemia into its sub-types and presented a comparative study of these algorithms.

AB  - Effective identification of leukocyte subtypes in microscopic images can help doctors diagnose diseases more accurately. Previous studies have achieved well performance by using segmentation techniques for multi-step processing. However, this increases the complexity of the whole identification process. In this paper, we proposed a novel model structure that can be trained end-to-end. The model combines attention mechanisms to emphasize the most discriminative features, and bilinear strategy to capture the interactions between features. We called this model Bilinear Self-Attention Network (BSA-Net). BSA-Net directly performs leukocyte subtypes identification in a one-step manner, which not only reduces complexity, but also achieves higher accuracy. To better understand the impact of the attention mechanism, we visualized the attention feature map in the BSA-Net model. Experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method, which can meet the requirements of doctors for the accuracy and timeliness of cell identification results.

AB  - In the medical field, the analysis of the blood sample of the patient is a critical task. Abnormalities in blood cells are accountable for various health issues. Red blood cells (RBCs) are one of the major components of blood. Classifying the RBC can allow us to diagnose different diseases. The traditional, time-consuming technique of visualizing RBC manually under the microscope, is a tedious task and may lead to wrong interpretation because of the human error. The various health conditions can change the shape, texture, and size of normal RBCs. The proposed method has involved the use of image processing to classify the RBCs with the help of convolution neural networks. The algorithm can extract the feature of each segmented cell image and classify it into 9 various types. Images of blood slides were collected from the hospital. The overall accuracy was 98.5%. The system has been developed to provide accurate and fast results that can save patients’ lives.

The convolutional network learns to extract meaningful features from images of blood cells using an embedding level approach and aggregates them in order to associate them with lymphocytosis, while the mixture-of-experts model combines information from these images as well as clinical attributes to form an end-to-end trainable pipeline for multi-modal data. Our results demonstrate that even the convolutional network by itself is able to discover meaningful associations between the images and the diagnosis, indicating the presence of important unexploited information in the images. A repeatability study is performed to demonstrate that the mixture-of-experts formulation is shown to be more robust without loss of performance. The proposed methods are compared with different methods from literature based both on conventional radiomics and machine learning, and on recent deep learning models based on attention mechanisms. Our method reports a balanced accuracy of 85.41% and outperfroms the radiomics-based and attention-based approaches as well that of biologists which scored 79.44%, 82.89% and 77.07% respectively. These results give insights on the potentials of the applicability of the proposed method in clinical practice.

AB  - Acute leukemia is a cancer-related to a bone marrow abnormality. It is more common in children and young adults. This type of leukemia generates unusual cell growth in a short period, requiring a quick start of treatment. Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) are the main responsible for deaths caused by this cancer. The classification of these two leukemia types on blood slide images is a vital process of and automatic system that can assist doctors in the selection of appropriate treatment. This work presents a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architecture capable of differentiating blood slides with ALL, AML and Healthy Blood Slides (HBS). The experiments were performed using 16 datasets with 2,415 images, and the accuracy of 97.18% and a precision of 97.23% were achieved. The proposed model results were compared with the results obtained by the state of the art methods, including also based on CNNs.

AB  - Leukemia is an abnormal proliferation of leukocytes in the bone marrow and blood and it is usually diagnosed by the pathologists by observing the blood smear under a microscope. The count of various cells and their morphological features are used by the pathologists to identify and classify leukemia. An abnormal increase in the count of immature leukocytes along with a reduced count of other blood cells may be an indication of leukemia. The Pathologist may then recommend for bone marrow examination to confirm and identify the specific type of leukemia. These conventional methods are time consuming and may be affected by the skill and expertise of the medical professionals involved in the diagnostic procedures. Image processing based methods can be used to analyze the microscopic smear images to detect the incidence of leukemia automatically and quickly. Image segmentation is one of the very important tasks in processing and analyzing medical images. In the proposed paper an attempt has been made to review the available works in the area of medical image processing of blood smear images, highlighting automated detection of leukemia. The available works in the related area are reviewed based on the segmentation method used. It is learnt that even though there are many studies for detection of acute leukemia only a very few studies are there for the detection of chronic leukemia. There are a few related review studies available in the literature but, none of the works classify the previous studies based on the segmentation method used.

AB  - The ability to phenotype cells is fundamentally important in biological research and medicine. Current methods rely primarily on fluorescence labeling of specific markers. However, there are many situations where this approach is unavailable or undesirable. Machine learning has been used for image cytometry but has been limited by cell agglomeration and it is currently unclear if this approach can reliably phenotype cells that are difficult to distinguish by the human eye. Here, we show disaggregated single cells can be phenotyped with a high degree of accuracy using low-resolution bright-field and non-specific fluorescence images of the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cytoskeleton. Specifically, we trained a convolutional neural network using automatically segmented images of cells from eight standard cancer cell-lines. These cells could be identified with an average F1-score of 95.3%, tested using separately acquired images. Our results demonstrate the potential to develop an “electronic eye” to phenotype cells directly from microscopy images.

AB  - Cancer is a fatal illness often caused by genetic disorder aggregation and a variety of pathological changes. Cancerous cells are abnormal areas often growing in any part of human body that are life-threatening. Cancer also known as tumor must be quickly and correctly detected in the initial stage to identify what might be beneficial for its cure. Even though modality has different considerations, such as complicated history, improper diagnostics and treatement that are main causes of deaths. The aim of the research is to analyze, review, categorize and address the current developments of human body cancer detection using machine learning techniques for breast, brain, lung, liver, skin cancer leukemia. The study highlights how cancer diagnosis, cure process is assisted using machine learning with supervised, unsupervised and deep learning techniques. Several state of art techniques are categorized under the same cluster and results are compared on benchmark datasets from accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, false-positive metrics. Finally, challenges are also highlighted for possible future work.

AB  - This work shows the advantage of expert knowledge for leukemic cell recognition. In the medical area, visual analysis of microscopic images has regularly used biological samples to recognize hematological disorders. Nowadays, techniques of image recognition are needed to achieve an adequate identification of blood tissues. This paper presents a procedure to acquire expert knowledge from blood cell images. We apply Gaussian mixtures, evolutionary computing, and standard techniques of image processing to extract knowledge. This information feeds a support vector machine or multilayer perceptron to classify healthy or leukemic cells. Additionally, convolutional neural networks are used as a benchmark to compare our proposed method with the state of the art. We use a public database of 260 healthy and leukemic cell images. Results show that our traditional pattern recognition methodology matches deep learning accuracy since the recognition of blood cells achieves 99.63%, whereas the convolutional neural networks reach 97.74% on average. Moreover, the computational effort of our approach is minimal, while meeting the requirement of being explainable.

T2  - Medical Image Analysis
AB  - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a pervasive pediatric white blood cell cancer across the globe. With the popularity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), computer-aided diagnosis of cancer has attracted considerable attention. Such tools are easily deployable and are cost-effective. Hence, these can enable extensive coverage of cancer diagnostic facilities. However, the development of such a tool for ALL cancer was challenging so far due to the non-availability of a large training dataset. The visual similarity between the malignant and normal cells adds to the complexity of the problem. This paper discusses the recent release of a large dataset and presents a novel deep learning architecture for the classification of cell images of ALL cancer. The proposed architecture, namely, SDCT-AuxNetθ is a 2-module framework that utilizes a compact CNN as the main classifier in one module and a Kernel SVM as the auxiliary classifier in the other one. While CNN classifier uses features through bilinear-pooling, spectral-averaged features are used by the auxiliary classifier. Further, this CNN is trained on the stain deconvolved quantity images in the optical density domain instead of the conventional RGB images. A novel test strategy is proposed that exploits both the classifiers for decision making using the confidence scores of their predicted class labels. Elaborate experiments have been carried out on our recently released public dataset of 15114 images of ALL cancer and healthy cells to establish the validity of the proposed methodology that is also robust to subject-level variability. A weighted F1 score of 94.8% is obtained that is best so far on this challenging dataset.

AB  - The classification of six types of white blood cells (WBCs) is considered essential for leukemia diagnosis, while the classification is labor-intensive and strict with the clinical experience. To relieve the complicated process with an efficient and automatic method, we propose the Attention-aware Residual Network based Manifold Learning model (ARML) to classify WBCs. The proposed ARML model leverages the adaptive attention-aware residual learning to exploit the category-relevant image-level features and strengthen the first-order feature representation ability. To learn more discriminatory information than the first-order ones, the second-order features are characterized. Afterwards, ARML encodes both the first- and second-order features with Gaussian embedding into the Riemannian manifold to learn the underlying non-linear structure of the features for classification. ARML can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, and the learnable parameters are iteratively optimized. 10800 WBCs images (1800 images for each type) is collected, 9000 images and five-fold cross-validation are used for training and validation of the model, while additional 1800 images for testing. The results show that ARML achieving average classification accuracy of 0.953 outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with fewer trainable parameters. In the ablation study, ARML achieves improved accuracy against its three variants: without manifold learning (AR), without attention-aware learning (RML), and AR without attention-aware learning. The t-SNE results illustrate that ARML has learned more distinguishable features than the comparison methods, which benefits the WBCs classification. ARML provides a clinically feasible WBCs classification solution for leukemia diagnose with an efficient manner.

AB  - Bone marrow aspirate (BMA) differential cell counts (DCCs) are critical for the classification of hematologic disorders. While manual counts are considered the gold standard, they are labor intensive, time consuming, and subject to bias. A reliable automated counter has yet to be developed, largely due to the inherent complexity of bone marrow specimens. Digital pathology imaging coupled with machine learning algorithms represents a highly promising emerging technology for this purpose. Yet, training datasets for BMA cellular constituents, critical for building and validating machine learning algorithms, are lacking. Herein, we report our experience creating and employing such datasets to develop a machine learning algorithm to detect and classify BMA cells. Utilizing a web-based system that we developed for annotating and managing digital pathology images, over 10,000 cells from scanned whole slide images of BMA smears were manually annotated, including all classes that comprise the standard clinical DCC. We implemented a two-stage, detection and classification approach that allows design flexibility and improved classification accuracy. In a sixfold cross-validation, our algorithms achieved high overall accuracy in detection (0.959 ± 0.008 precision-recall AUC) and classification (0.982 ± 0.03 ROC AUC) using nonneoplastic samples. Testing on a small set of acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma samples demonstrated similar detection and classification performance. In summary, our algorithms showed promising early results and represent an important initial step in the effort to devise a reliable, objective method to automate DCCs. With further development to include formal clinical validation, such a system has the potential to assist in disease diagnosis and prognosis, and significantly impact clinical practice.

AB  - Purpose Leukemia is a lethal disease that is harmful to bone marrow and overall blood health. The classification of white blood cell images is crucial for leukemia diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to classify white blood cells by extracting discriminative information from cell segmentation and combining it with the fine-grained features. We propose a hybrid adversarial residual network with support vector machine (SVM), which utilizes the extracted features to improve the classification accuracy for human peripheral white cells. Methods Firstly, we segment the cell and nucleus by utilizing an adversarial residual network, which contains a segmentation network and a discriminator network. To extract features that can handle the inter-class consistency problem effectively, we introduce the adversarial residual network. Then, we utilize convolutional neural network (CNN) features and histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features, which can extract discriminative features from images of segmented cell nuclei. To utilize the representative features fully, a discriminative network is introduced to deal with neighboring information at different scales. Finally, we combine the vectors of HOG features with those of CNN features and feed them into a linear SVM to classify white blood cells into six types. Results We used three methods to evaluate the effect of leukocyte classification based on 5000 leukocyte images acquired from a local hospital. The first approach is to use the CNN features as the input of SVM to classify leukocytes, which achieved 94.23% specificity, 95.10% sensitivity, and 94.41% accuracy. The use of the HOG features for SVM achieved 83.50% specificity, 87.50% sensitivity, and 85.00% accuracy. The use of combined CNN and HOG features achieved 94.57% specificity, 96.11% sensitivity, and 95.93% accuracy. Conclusions We propose a novel hybrid adversarial-discriminative network for the classification of microscopic leukocyte images. It improves the accuracy of cell classification, reduces the difficulty and time pressure of doctors’ work, and economizes the valuable time of doctors in daily clinical diagnosis.

AB  - Resumo
					Data augmentation is a key procedure in many image classification tasks, mainly to overcome the problem of small datasets. In this work, we exploit the data augmentation as a hyperparameter optimization approach. We tested our methods to classify erythrocytes to assist the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia. In this study, we proposed a data augmentation approach based on hyperparameter optimization to find the best augmentation policies through the Bayesian optimization algorithm. We also developed a convolutional neural network architecture from scratch and compared it with two classic architectures to classify sickle cell images. Our approach defines the best data augmentation solutions and sends those solutions to be carried out by CNN in the final training. All experiments were validated using a stratified five-fold cross-validation procedure, and our best result achieves 92.54% of accuracy. The results suggest the best augmentation policies defined with optimization allow us to obtain superior results than other strategies such as without data augmentation, several randomly defined image transformations, and only random rotations. As far as we know, our paper is the first to propose optimizing data augmentation policies in biomedical images leading to a better exploration of these strategies in several fields.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) is gaining increased interest in clinical laboratory medicine, mainly triggered by the decreased cost of generating and storing data using laboratory automation and computational power, and the widespread accessibility of open source tools. Nevertheless, only a handful of ML-based products are currently commercially available for routine clinical laboratory practice. In this review, we start with an introduction to ML by providing an overview of the ML landscape, its general workflow, and the most commonly used algorithms for clinical laboratory applications. Furthermore, we aim to illustrate recent evolutions (2018 to mid-2020) of the techniques used in the clinical laboratory setting and discuss the associated challenges and opportunities. In the field of clinical chemistry, the reviewed applications of ML algorithms include quality review of lab results, automated urine sediment analysis, disease or outcome prediction from routine laboratory parameters, and interpretation of complex biochemical data. In the hematology subdiscipline, we discuss the concepts of automated blood film reporting and malaria diagnosis. At last, we handle a broad range of clinical microbiology applications, such as the reduction of diagnostic workload by laboratory automation, the detection and identification of clinically relevant microorganisms, and the detection of antimicrobial resistance.

T2  - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)
AB  - Multi-scale features exist widely in biomedical images. For example, the scale of lesions may vary greatly according to different diseases. Effective representation of multi-scale features is essential for fully perceiving and understanding objects, which guarantees the performance of models. However, in biomedical image tasks, the insufficiency of data may prevent models from effectively capturing multi-scale features. In this paper, we propose Feature Pyramid Block (FPB), a novel structure to improve multi-scale feature representation within a single convolutional layer, which can be easily plugged into existing convolutional networks. Experiments on public biomedical image datasets prove consistent performance improvement with FPB. Furthermore, the convergence speed is faster and the computational costs are lower when using FPB, which proves high efficiency of our method.

TI  - Automated Semantic Segmentation of Red Blood Cells for Sickle Cell Disease
AU  - Zhang, M.

T2  - IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics
AB  - Red blood cell (RBC) segmentation and classification from microscopic images is a crucial step for the diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD). In this work, we adopt a deep learning based semantic segmentation framework to solve the RBC classification task. A major challenge for robust segmentation and classification is the large variations on the size, shape and viewpoint of the cells, combining with the low image quality caused by noise and artifacts. To address these challenges, we apply deformable convolution layers to the classic U-Net structure and implement the deformable U-Net (dU-Net). U-Net architecture has been shown to offer accurate localization for image semantic segmentation. Moreover, deformable convolution enables free-form deformation of the feature learning process, thus making the network more robust to various cell morphologies and image settings. dU-Net is tested on microscopic red blood cell images from patients with sickle cell disease. Results show that dU-Net can achieve highest accuracy for both binary segmentation and multi-class semantic segmentation tasks, comparing with both unsupervised and state-of-the-art deep learning based supervised segmentation methods. Through detailed investigation of the segmentation results, we further conclude that the performance improvement is mainly caused by the deformable convolution layer, which has better ability to separate the touching cells, discriminate the background noise and predict correct cell shapes without any shape priors.

TI  - Human peripheral blood leukocyte classification method based on convolutional neural network and data augmentation
AU  - Wang, Yapin
AU  - Cao, Yiping
T2  - Medical Physics
AB  - Purpose Human peripheral blood leukocytes’ classification is important for diagnosing blood diseases. Many microscopic leukocyte image automatic detection methods are proposed. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied to microscopic leukocyte image automatic classification. But when a CNN is used for microscopic leukocyte image classification, the dataset’s scarcity and imbalance will lead to low classification accuracy. To improve classification accuracy, a data augmentation method is proposed, and a resampling method is adopted when using a CNN method. Methods First, a deep CNN model for microscopic leukocyte image classification is designed. Then, a new data augmentation method based on feature concentration is proposed to enrich the dataset and overcome the problem of dataset scarcity. To make the CNN model focus on the leukocyte region, many images are generated by putting a segmented leukocyte into images with different microscopic surroundings using an image processing method. Finally, taking the imbalance of the five kinds of leukocytes in the dataset into consideration, a resampling method is adopted. The resampling method iteratively feeds the leukocyte images with a low proportion to the CNN model within an epoch to ensure that images of each of the five kinds of leukocytes are represented in relatively equal numbers in each batch. Results The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed classification method can achieve 97.6% average testing accuracy. Classification precision for the five kinds of leukocytes is above 93.4%, while sensitivity is above 92.5%. Both the proposed data augmentation and the resampling methods improve classification accuracy. Conclusions A human peripheral blood leukocyte classification method based on a CNN and data augmentation is proposed. The problem of dataset scarcity is solved by the proposed data augmentation method, and the dataset imbalance is solved by a resampling method.

AB  - In this paper, we demonstrate a machine learning algorithm with multiple GPU processing in hematocytes detection. Object detection in compound microscopy images presents a specific task. Microscopy image import directly to a specimen slide under the compound microscope by an image sensor device. We propose Faster R-CNN with a customizing model applying cutting-edge object detection systems. The MicrosisDCN (Microbes Diagnosis with Deep Convolutional Neural Network) deploys Faster R-CNN in python script configures to access multiple GPUs computation with 7168 CUDA cores of dual GPUs with Linux command options: worker_replicas and num_clones equal to several graphics processing units. The datasets consist of hematocytes extracted from raw slides under a microscope. These images separate the cells of interest into three groups: red blood cell (RBCs), white blood cell (WBCs), and platelets. The training dataset consists of 80 percent of the 40,000 images. And the testing dataset consists of 20 percent of the 40,000 images. Our algorithm also provides the result of mean average precision (mAP) and enables multiple GPU training models in Tensorflow and OpenCV. The mAP is the average of average precision (AP) with intersection-over-union (IoU) in measuring the score of object detection accuracy. If the mAP score approaches 1.0, it indicates well accuracy. Our 9,000 steps valuation algorithm model by the python script estimates the mAP in 3 groups: RBCs, WBCs, and platelets as about 0.9147, 0.9664, and 0.9548. The optimum would be at nearly 12,000 steps because the algorithm estimates the mAP model as 0.96 in all types. The experiment aims to verify the neural network model using a compound microscope.

AB  - This paper addresses digital staining and classification of the unstained white blood cell images obtained with a differential contrast microscope. We have data coming from multiple domains that are partially labeled and partially matching across the domains. Using unstained images removes time-consuming staining procedures and could facilitate and automatize comprehensive diagnostics. To this aim, we propose a method that translates unstained images to realistically looking stained images preserving the inter-cellular structures, crucial for the medical experts to perform classification. We achieve better structure preservation by adding auxiliary tasks of segmentation and direct reconstruction. Segmentation enforces that the network learns to generate correct nucleus and cytoplasm shape, while direct reconstruction enforces reliable translation between the matching images across domains. Besides, we build a robust domain agnostic latent space by injecting the target domain label directly to the generator, i.e., bypassing the encoder. It allows the encoder to extract features independently of the target domain and enables an automated domain invariant classification of the white blood cells. We validated our method on a large dataset composed of leukocytes of 24 patients, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both digital staining and classification tasks.

AB  - In this study, we developed the world's first artificial intelligence (AI) system that assesses the dysplasia of blood cells on bone marrow smears and presents the result of AI prediction for one of the most representative dysplasia—decreased granules (DG). We photographed field images from the bone marrow smears from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or non-MDS diseases and cropped each cell using an originally developed cell detector. Two morphologists labelled each cell. The degree of dysplasia was evaluated on a four-point scale: 0–3 (e.g., neutrophil with severely decreased granules were labelled DG3). We then constructed the classifier from the dataset of labelled images. The detector and classifier were based on a deep neural network pre-trained with natural images. We obtained 1797 labelled images, and the morphologists determined 134 DGs (DG1: 46, DG2: 77, DG3: 11). Subsequently, we performed a five-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the classifier. For DG1–3 labelled by morphologists, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were 91.0%, 97.7%, 76.3%, 99.3%, and 97.2%, respectively. When DG1 was excluded in the process, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 85.2%, 98.9%, 80.6%, and 99.2% and 98.2%, respectively.

AB  - Multiple myeloma cancer is caused by the abnormal growth of plasma cells in the bone marrow. The most commonly used method for diagnosis of multiple myeloma is Bone marrow aspiration, where the aspirate slide images are either observed visually or passed onto existing digital image processing software for the detection of myeloma cells. The current work explores the effectiveness of deep learning based object detection/segmentation algorithms such as Mask-RCNN and unet for the detection of multiple myeloma. The manual polygon annotation of the current dataset is performed using VGG image annotation software. The deep learning models were trained by monitoring the train and validation loss per epoch and the best model was selected based on the minimal loss for the validation data. From the comparison results obtained for both the models, it is observed that Mask-RCNN has competing results than unet and it addresses most of the challenges existing in multiple myeloma segmentation.

AU  - Wang, Yapin

T2  - Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing
AB  - A computer-assisted human peripheral blood leukocyte image classification method based on Siamese network is proposed. Firstly, a Siamese network with two identical convolutional neural network (CNN) sub-networks and a logistic regression for leukocyte five classification is designed, which can learn not only distinguishing features but also a similarity metric. Then for each category of the leukocytes, a typical sample is selected by the hematologist. To train the Siamese network, a leukocyte and a typical sample that belong to the same category make up a genuine pair and the leukocyte with the rest four typical samples respectively make up four impostor pairs. Obviously, the number of the genuine pairs is lesser than that of the impostor pairs. Thus, a data augmentation method suitable for leukocyte is used to enrich the amount of the genuine pairs. By training the Siamese network using the genuine pairs and impostor pairs, the Siamese network can not only shorten the similarity metric between the leukocyte and the same category of the typical sample but also increase the similarity metrics between the leukocyte and the different categories of the typical samples. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve 98.8% average testing accuracy.

AB  - <b><i>Introduction:</i></b> The nucleated-cell differential count on the bone marrow aspirate smears is required for the clinical diagnosis of hematological malignancy. Manual bone marrow differential count is time consuming and lacks consistency. In this study, a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based system was developed to perform cell automatic classification of bone marrow cells and determine its potential clinical applications. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Bone marrow aspirate smears were collected from the Xinqiao Hospital of Army Medical University. First, an automated analysis system (<i>Morphogo</i>) scanned and generated whole digital images of bone marrow smears. Then, the nucleated marrow cells in the selected areas of the smears at a magnification of ×1,000 were analyzed by the software utilizing an AI-based platform. The cell classification results were further reviewed and confirmed independently by 2 experienced pathologists. The automatic cell classification performance of the system was evaluated using 3 categories: accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Correlation coefficients and linear regression equations between automatic cell classification by the AI-based system and concurrent manual differential count were calculated. <b><i>Results:</i></b> In 230 cases, the classification accuracy was above 85.7% for hematopoietic lineage cells. Averages of sensitivity and specificity of the system were found to be 69.4 and 97.2%, respectively. The differential cell percentage of the automated count based on 200–500 cell counts was correlated with differential cell percentage provided by the pathologists for granulocytes, erythrocytes, and lymphocytes (<i>r</i> ≥ 0.762, <i>p</i> &#x3c; 0.001). <b><i>Discussion/Conclusion:</i></b> This pilot study confirmed that the <i>Morphogo</i> system is a reliable tool for automatic bone marrow cell differential count analysis and has potential for clinical applications. Current ongoing large-scale multicenter validation studies will provide more information to further confirm the clinical utility of the system.

AB  - Lymphoma has become the seventh most common cancer expected to occur and the ninth most common cause of cancer death in both males and females. However, pathological diagnosis as the main diagnostic method is time-consuming, expensive and error-prone. Nowadays, with the outstanding performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in image analysis, its application in medical image classification and segmentation is becoming more and more widespread. Since Faster R-CNN achieves state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets, in this work, we use it to identify lymphoma cells from a dataset of blood cells. In order to achieve this goal, first, we focus on a new blood cell dataset that mainly consists of lymphoma cells, blasts and lymphocytes. This dataset will be used to fine-tune a pre-trained network. Then, we use two training methods and three networks to train the same dataset respectively. Finally, we choose the best trained model to diagnose lymphoma cells in a new dataset which also contains lymphoma cells, blasts and lymphocytes. The detection rate of lymphoma cells was higher than 96%, and the false detection rate was less than 13%, which is an improvement compared with the previously proposed results. The results show a potential of the proposed method in lymphoma diagnosis.

AB  - Analyzing cells and tissues under a microscope is a cornerstone of biological research and clinical practice. However, the challenge faced by conventional microscopy image analysis is the fact that cell recognition through a microscope is still time-consuming and lacks both accuracy and consistency. Despite enormous progress in computer-aided microscopy cell detection, especially with recent deep-learning-based techniques, it is still difficult to translate an established method directly to a new cell target without extensive modification. The morphology of a cell is complex and highly varied, but it has long been known that cells show a nonrandom geometrical order in which a distinct and defined shape can be formed in a given type of cell. Thus, we have proposed a geometry-aware deep-learning method, geometric-feature spectrum ExtremeNet (GFS-ExtremeNet), for cell detection. GFS-ExtremeNet is built on the framework of ExtremeNet with a collection of geometric features, resulting in the accurate detection of any given cell target. We obtained promising detection results with microscopic images of publicly available mammalian cell nuclei and newly collected protozoa, whose cell shapes and sizes varied. Even more striking, our method was able to detect unicellular parasites within red blood cells without misdiagnosis of each other.
IMPORTANCE Automated diagnostic microscopy powered by deep learning is useful, particularly in rural areas. However, there is no general method for object detection of different cells. In this study, we developed GFS-ExtremeNet, a geometry-aware deep-learning method which is based on the detection of four extreme key points for each object (topmost, bottommost, rightmost, and leftmost) and its center point. A postprocessing step, namely, adjacency spectrum, was employed to measure whether the distances between the key points were below a certain threshold for a particular cell candidate. Our newly proposed geometry-aware deep-learning method outperformed other conventional object detection methods and could be applied to any type of cell with a certain geometrical order. Our GFS-ExtremeNet approach opens a new window for the development of an automated cell detection system.

AB  - White blood cells (WBCs) protect human body against different types of infections including fungal, parasitic, viral, and bacterial. The detection of abnormal regions in WBCs is a difficult task. Therefore a method is proposed for the localization of WBCs based on YOLOv2-Nucleus-Cytoplasm, which contains darkNet-19 as a basenetwork of the YOLOv2 model. In this model features are extracted from LeakyReLU-18 of darkNet-19 and supplied as an input to the YOLOv2 model. The YOLOv2-Nucleus-Cytoplasm model localizes and classifies the WBCs with maximum score labels. It also localize the WBCs into the blast and non-blast cells. After localization, the bag-of-features are extracted and optimized by using particle swarm optimization(PSO). The improved feature vector is fed to classifiers i.e., optimized naïve Bayes (O-NB) & optimized discriminant analysis (O-DA) for WBCs classification. The experiments are performed on LISC, ALL-IDB1, and ALL-IDB2 datasets.

TI  - Improved Classification of White Blood Cells with the Generative Adversarial Network and Deep Convolutional Neural Network
AU  - Almezhghwi, Khaled

T2  - Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience
AB  - White blood cells (leukocytes) are a very important component of the blood that forms the immune system, which is responsible for fighting foreign elements. The five types of white blood cells include neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and basophils, where each type constitutes a different proportion and performs specific functions. Being able to classify and, therefore, count these different constituents is critical for assessing the health of patients and infection risks. Generally, laboratory experiments are used for determining the type of a white blood cell. The staining process and manual evaluation of acquired images under the microscope are tedious and subject to human errors. Moreover, a major challenge is the unavailability of training data that cover the morphological variations of white blood cells so that trained classifiers can generalize well. As such, this paper investigates image transformation operations and generative adversarial networks (GAN) for data augmentation and state-of-the-art deep neural networks (i.e., VGG-16, ResNet, and DenseNet) for the classification of white blood cells into the five types. Furthermore, we explore initializing the DNNs’ weights randomly or using weights pretrained on the CIFAR-100 dataset. In contrast to other works that require advanced image preprocessing and manual feature extraction before classification, our method works directly with the acquired images. The results of extensive experiments show that the proposed method can successfully classify white blood cells. The best DNN model, DenseNet-169, yields a validation accuracy of 98.8%. Particularly, we find that the proposed approach outperforms other methods that rely on sophisticated image processing and manual feature engineering.

AB  - The object detection, which has been widely applied in the biomedical field already, is of real significance but technically challenging. In practice, the object detection accuracy is vulnerable to labeling quality, which is usually not a big headache for simple algorithm or model verification since there are a bunch of ideal public available datasets whose classes and tags are all well-marked. However, in real scenarios, image data is often partially or even incorrectly labeled. Particularly, in cell detection, this becomes a thorny issue since the labelling of the dataset is incomplete and inaccurate. To address this issue, we propose a data-augmentation algorithm that can generate full labeled cell image data from incomplete labeled ones. First of all, we randomly extract the labeled objects from raw cell images, and meanwhile, keep their corresponding position information. Next, we employ the framework of cycle-consistent adversarial network, but significantly distinguished from the original one, to generate fully labeled data including both objects and backgrounds. We conduct extensive experiments on a blood cell classification dataset called BCCD to evaluate our model, and experimental results show that our proposed method can successfully address the weak annotation problem and improve the performance of object detection.

AB  - Automatic detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in microscopic images is a very challenging task due to the variable artificial and environmental factors, such as inconsistency of light intensity and staining, cell adhesion, multiple impurities and so on. In order to meet these challenges, we propose a novel deep multiscale residual network (DMRN) for CTCs detection. Compared with existing methods either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with shallower architectures, our deep networks can acquire more discriminative features for more accurate detection. To train very deep networks more efficiently, we propose a set of schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data. First, we apply the residual learning to generate more discriminative features and overcome the overfitting problem when a network goes to deeper. Then, a fully residual convolutional network (FRCN) is proposed to produce the prediction maps of CTCs. Finally, we propose to integrate multi-scale contextual information in proposed FRCN and fuse these prediction maps both global and local features of CTCs, making the prediction more accurate and robust. We built three DMRN models to study the impact of network depth on model performance. Each model was tested on our own dataset containing complex jamming information. The DRMN-50 model which has a depth of 50 layers performs best among three models with Jaccard-index of 0.810 (with a pixel accuracy of 99.8% as a reference index) and its performance outperform other existing state-of-art methods such as U-Net in other domain. The result also depicts the accurate and robust performance of proposed method in complex environment.

AB  - Morphometric analysis of nuclei play an essential role in cytological diagnostics. Cytological samples contain hundreds or thousands of nuclei that need to be examined for cancer. The process is tedious and time-consuming but can be automated. Unfortunately, segmentation of cytological samples is very challenging due to the complexity of cellular structures. To deal with this problem, we are proposing an approach, which combines convolutional neural network and ellipse fitting algorithm to segment nuclei in cytological images of breast cancer. Images are preprocessed by the colour deconvolution procedure to extract hematoxylin-stained objects (nuclei). Next, convolutional neural network is performing semantic segmentation of preprocessed image to extract nuclei silhouettes. To find the exact location of nuclei and to separate touching and overlapping nuclei, we approximate them using ellipses of various sizes and orientations. They are fitted using the Bayesian object recognition approach. The accuracy of the proposed approach is evaluated with the help of reference nuclei segmented manually. Tests carried out on breast cancer images have shown that the proposed method can accurately segment elliptic-shaped objects.

AB  - The detection, counting, and precise segmentation of white blood cells in cytological images are vital steps in the effective diagnosis of several cancers. This paper introduces an efficient method for automatic recognition of white blood cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow images based on deep learning to alleviate tedious tasks for hematologists in clinical practice. First, input image pre-processing was proposed before applying a deep neural network model adapted to cells localization and segmentation. Then, model outputs were improved by using combined predictions and corrections. Finally, a new algorithm that uses the cooperation between model results and spatial information was implemented to improve the segmentation quality. To implement our model, python language, Tensorflow, and Keras libraries were used. The calculations were executed using NVIDIA GPU 1080, while the datasets used in our experiments came from patients in the Hemobiology service of Tlemcen Hospital (Algeria). The results were promising and showed the efficiency, power, and speed of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods. In addition to its accuracy of 95.73%, the proposed approach provided fast predictions (less than 1 s).

AB  - Digital Pathology is the process of converting histology glass slides to digital images using sophisticated computerized technology to facilitate acquisition, evaluation, storage, and portability of histologic information. By its nature, digitization of analog histology data renders it amenable to analysis using deep learning/artificial intelligence (DL/AI) techniques. The application of DL/AI to digital pathology data holds promise, even if the scope of use cases and regulatory framework for deploying such applications in the clinical environment remains in the early stages. Recent studies using whole-slide images and DL/AI to detect histologic abnormalities in general and cancer in particular have shown encouraging results. In this review, we focus on these emerging technologies intended for use in diagnostic hematology and the evaluation of lymphoproliferative diseases.

AB  - Stored red blood cells (RBCs) are needed for life-saving blood transfusions, but they undergo continuous degradation. RBC storage lesions are often assessed by microscopic examination or biochemical and biophysical assays, which are complex, time-consuming, and destructive to fragile cells. Here we demonstrate the use of label-free imaging flow cytometry and deep learning to characterize RBC lesions. Using brightfield images, a trained neural network achieved 76.7% agreement with experts in classifying seven clinically relevant RBC morphologies associated with storage lesions, comparable to 82.5% agreement between different experts. Given that human observation and classification may not optimally discern RBC quality, we went further and eliminated subjective human annotation in the training step by training a weakly supervised neural network using only storage duration times. The feature space extracted by this network revealed a chronological progression of morphological changes that better predicted blood quality, as measured by physiological hemolytic assay readouts, than the conventional expert-assessed morphology classification system. With further training and clinical testing across multiple sites, protocols, and instruments, deep learning and label-free imaging flow cytometry might be used to routinely and objectively assess RBC storage lesions. This would automate a complex protocol, minimize laboratory sample handling and preparation, and reduce the impact of procedural errors and discrepancies between facilities and blood donors. The chronology-based machine-learning approach may also improve upon humans' assessment of morphological changes in other biomedically important progressions, such as differentiation and metastasis.

AB  - We introduce machine learning (ML) to perform classification and quantitation of images of nuclei from human blood neutrophils. Here we assessed the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using free, open source software to accurately quantitate neutrophil NETosis, a recently discovered process involved in multiple human diseases. CNNs achieved >94% in performance accuracy in differentiating NETotic from non-NETotic cells and vastly facilitated dose-response analysis and screening of the NETotic response in neutrophils from patients. Using only features learned from nuclear morphology, CNNs can distinguish between NETosis and necrosis and between distinct NETosis signaling pathways, making them a precise tool for NETosis detection. Furthermore, by using CNNs and tools to determine object dispersion, we uncovered differences in NETotic nuclei clustering between major NETosis pathways that is useful in understanding NETosis signaling events. Our study also shows that neutrophils from patients with sickle cell disease were unresponsive to one of two major NETosis pathways. Thus, we demonstrate the design, performance, and implementation of ML tools for rapid quantitative and qualitative cell analysis in basic science.

AB  - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer. While there are a number of well-recognized prognostic biomarkers at diagnosis, the most powerful independent prognostic factor is the response of the leukemia to induction chemotherapy (Campana and Pui: Blood 129 (2017) 1913-1918). Given the potential for machine learning to improve precision medicine, we tested its capacity to monitor disease in children undergoing ALL treatment. Diagnostic and on-treatment bone marrow samples were labeled with an ALL-discriminating antibody combination and analyzed by imaging flow cytometry. Ignoring the fluorescent markers and using only features extracted from bright-field and dark-field cell images, a deep learning model was able to identify ALL cells at an accuracy of >88%. This antibody-free, single cell method is cheap, quick, and could be adapted to a simple, laser-free cytometer to allow automated, point-of-care testing to detect slow early responders. Adaptation to other types of leukemia is feasible, which would revolutionize residual disease monitoring. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hematological disorder leading to blood vessel occlusion accompanied by painful episodes and even death. Red blood cells (RBCs) of SCD patients have diverse shapes that reveal important biomechanical and bio-rheological characteristics, e.g. their density, fragility, adhesive properties, etc. Hence, having an objective and effective way of RBC shape quantification and classification will lead to better insights and eventual better prognosis of the disease. To this end, we have developed an automated, high-throughput, ex-vivo RBC shape classification framework that consists of three stages. First, we present an automatic hierarchical RBC extraction method to detect the RBC region (ROI) from the background, and then separate touching RBCs in the ROI images by applying an improved random walk method based on automatic seed generation. Second, we apply a mask-based RBC patch-size normalization method to normalize the variant size of segmented single RBC patches into uniform size. Third, we employ deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to realize RBC classification; the alternating convolution and pooling operations can deal with non-linear and complex patterns. Furthermore, we investigate the specific shape factor quantification for the classified RBC image data in order to develop a general multiscale shape analysis. We perform several experiments on raw microscopy image datasets from 8 SCD patients (over 7,000 single RBC images) through a 5-fold cross validation method both for oxygenated and deoxygenated RBCs. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can successfully classify sickle shape RBCs in an automated manner with high accuracy, and we also provide the corresponding shape factor analysis, which can be used synergistically with the CNN analysis for more robust predictions. Moreover, the trained deep CNN exhibits good performance even for a deoxygenated dataset and distinguishes the subtle differences in texture alteration inside the oxygenated and deoxygenated RBCs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy remain the gold standard for the diagnosis of hematological diseases despite the development of flow cytometry (FCM) and molecular and gene analyses. However, the interpretation of the results is laborious and operator dependent. Furthermore, the obtained results exhibit inter- and intravariations among specialists. Therefore, it is important to develop a more objective and automated analysis system. Several deep learning models have been developed and applied in medical image analysis but not in the field of hematological histology, especially for bone marrow smear applications.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a deep learning model (BMSNet) for assisting hematologists in the interpretation of bone marrow smears for faster diagnosis and disease monitoring.
METHODS: From January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, 122 bone marrow smears were photographed and divided into a development cohort (N=42), a validation cohort (N=70), and a competition cohort (N=10). The development cohort included 17,319 annotated cells from 291 high-resolution photos. In total, 20 photos were taken for each patient in the validation cohort and the competition cohort. This study included eight annotation categories: erythroid, blasts, myeloid, lymphoid, plasma cells, monocyte, megakaryocyte, and unable to identify. BMSNet is a convolutional neural network with the YOLO v3 architecture, which detects and classifies single cells in a single model. Six visiting staff members participated in a human-machine competition, and the results from the FCM were regarded as the ground truth.
RESULTS: In the development cohort, according to 6-fold cross-validation, the average precision of the bounding box prediction without consideration of the classification is 67.4%. After removing the bounding box prediction error, the precision and recall of BMSNet were similar to those of the hematologists in most categories. In detecting more than 5% of blasts in the validation cohort, the area under the curve (AUC) of BMSNet (0.948) was higher than the AUC of the hematologists (0.929) but lower than the AUC of the pathologists (0.985). In detecting more than 20% of blasts, the AUCs of the hematologists (0.981) and pathologists (0.980) were similar and were higher than the AUC of BMSNet (0.942). Further analysis showed that the performance difference could be attributed to the myelodysplastic syndrome cases. In the competition cohort, the mean value of the correlations between BMSNet and FCM was 0.960, and the mean values of the correlations between the visiting staff and FCM ranged between 0.952 and 0.990.
CONCLUSIONS: Our deep learning model can assist hematologists in interpreting bone marrow smears by facilitating and accelerating the detection of hematopoietic cells. However, a detailed morphological interpretation still requires trained hematologists.

AB  - Drug susceptibility (also called chemosensitivity) is an important criterion for developing a therapeutic strategy for various cancer types such as breast cancer and leukemia. Recently, functional assays such as high-content screening together with genomic analysis have been shown to be effective for predicting drug susceptibility, but their clinical applicability is poor since they are time-consuming (several days long), labor-intensive, and costly. Here we present a highly simple, rapid, and cost-effective liquid biopsy for ex vivo drug-susceptibility testing of leukemia. The method is based on an extreme-throughput (>1 million cells per second), label-free, whole-blood imaging flow cytometer with a deep convolutional autoencoder, enabling image-based identification of the drug susceptibility of every single white blood cell in whole blood within 24 hours by simply flowing a drug-treated whole blood sample as little as 500 μL into the imaging flow cytometer without labeling. Our results show that the method accurately evaluates the drug susceptibility of white blood cells from untreated patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our method holds promise for affordable precision medicine.

AB  - The manual evaluation, classification and counting of biological objects demands for an enormous expenditure of time and subjective human input may be a source of error. Investigating the shape of red blood cells (RBCs) in microcapillary Poiseuille flow, we overcome this drawback by introducing a convolutional neural regression network for an automatic, outlier tolerant shape classification. From our experiments we expect two stable geometries: the so-called ‘slipper’ and ‘croissant’ shapes depending on the prevailing flow conditions and the cell-intrinsic parameters. Whereas croissants mostly occur at low shear rates, slippers evolve at higher flow velocities. With our method, we are able to find the transition point between both ‘phases’ of stable shapes which is of high interest to ensuing theoretical studies and numerical simulations. Using statistically based thresholds, from our data, we obtain so-called phase diagrams which are compared to manual evaluations. Prospectively, our concept allows us to perform objective analyses of measurements for a variety of flow conditions and to receive comparable results. Moreover, the proposed procedure enables unbiased studies on the influence of drugs on flow properties of single RBCs and the resulting macroscopic change of the flow behavior of whole blood.

AB  - Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) is a curative therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Relapse after HCT is the most common cause of treatment failure and is associated with poor prognosis. Early identification of which patients are at elevated risk of relapse may justify use of aggressive post-HCT treatment options, potentially preventing relapse and treatment failure. In this study, our goal was to predict relapse after HCT in AML patients using quantitative features extracted from digitized Wright-Giemsa stained posttransplant aspirate smears. We collected 39 aspirate specimens from a cohort of 39 AML patients after HCT, of which 25 experienced relapse, while 14 did not. Our approach comprised the following main steps. First, a deep learning model was developed to segment myeloblasts, a cell type in bone marrow that accumulates and characterizes AML. A total of 161 texture and shape descriptors were then extracted from these segmented myeloblasts. The top eight predictive features were identified using a Wilcoxon rank sum test over 100 iterations of 3-fold cross validation. A model was subsequently built employing these features and yielded an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80&plusmn;0.05 in cross validation. The top eight features include four Haralick texture features and four fractal dimension features. The texture features appear to characterize chromatin patterns in myeloblasts while the fractal features quantify morphological irregularity and complexity of myeloblasts, in alignment with findings previously reported for AML patients post-treatment.

AB  - Hematology is data-rich discipline and at the same time the hematological data are complex and often difficult to understand. Using deep learning methods, it is possible to solve a range of problems related to analyzing a large number of hematological preparations. This is particularly relevant for such activities as mass medical examination and distance microscopy as part of telemedicine system. This article discusses the possibility of using deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks to automate leukocyte microscopy. An approach to solving the problem of detecting and classifying cells in microscope images is proposed. The key components of biomedical image analysis pipeline are implemented including data preprocessing module, segmentation and image classification neural network models. The proposed pipeline is evaluated, and further directions of development are considered according to the obtained performance characteristics.

AB  - In myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), bone marrow (BM) histopathology is assessed to identify dysplastic cellular morphology, cellularity, and blast excess. Yet, other morphological findings may elude the human eye. We used convolutional neural networks to extract morphological features from 236 MDS, 87 MDS/MPN, and 11 control BM biopsies. These features predicted genetic and cytogenetic aberrations, prognosis, age, and gender in multivariate regression models. Highest prediction accuracy was found for TET2 (area under the receiver-operating curve [AUROC] 0.94) and spliceosome mutations (0.89) and chromosome 7 monosomy (0.89). Mutation prediction probability correlated with variant allele frequency and number of affected genes per pathway, demonstrating the algorithms' ability to identify relevant morphological patterns. By converting regression models to texture and cellular composition, we reproduced the classical del(5q) MDS morphology consisting of hypolobulated megakaryocytes. In summary, this study highlights the potential of linking deep BM histopathology with genetics and clinical variables.

AB  - <h3>Abstract</h3> <p>In myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), bone marrow (BM) histopathology is visually assessed to identify dysplastic cellular morphology, cellularity, and blast excess. Yet, many morphological findings elude the human eye. Here, we extracted visual features of 236 MDS, 87 MDS/MPN, and 10 control BM biopsies with convolutional neural networks. Unsupervised analysis distinguished underlying correlations between tissue composition, leukocyte metrics, and clinical characteristics. We applied morphological features in elastic net-regularized regression models to predict genetic and cytogenetic aberrations, prognosis, and clinical variables. By parallelizing tile, pixel, and leukocyte-level image analysis, we deconvoluted each model to texture and cellular composition to dissect their pathobiological context. Model-based mutation predictions correlated with variant allele frequency and number of affected genes per pathway, demonstrating the models’ ability to identify relevant visual patterns. In summary, this study highlights the potential of deep histopathology in hematology by unveiling the fundamental association of BM morphology with genetic and clinical determinants.</p>

AB  - Recently, deep learning frameworks have been shown to be successful and efficient in processing digital histology images for various detection and classification tasks. Among these tasks, cell detection and classification are key steps in many computer-assisted diagnosis systems. Traditionally, cell detection and classification is performed as a sequence of two consecutive steps by using two separate deep learning networks: one for detection and the other for classification. This strategy inevitably increases the computational complexity of the training stage. In this paper, we propose a synchronized deep autoencoder network for simultaneous detection and classification of cells in bone marrow histology images. The proposed network uses a single architecture to detect the positions of cells and classify the detected cells, in parallel. It uses a curvesupport Gaussian model to compute probability maps that allow detecting irregularly shape cells precisely. Moreover, the network includes a novel neighborhood selection mechanism to boost the classification accuracy. We show that the performance of the proposed network is superior than traditional deep learning detection methods and very competitive compared to traditional deep learning classification networks. Runtime comparison also shows that our network requires less time to be trained.

AB  - Recently, deep learning approaches have been shown to be successful for analyzing histopathological images. In general, cell detection and classification are separated and assigned into two different networks, resulting in increased computational complexity for training the deep netwrok. Here we propose a novel deep autoencoder structure for classification with detection. This novel network uses one deep autoencoder to detect the positions of cells and classify types of cells simultaneously. In addition, the proposed network can efficiently detect the cells with irregular shape. The performance of the proposed method is shown to be similar to that of conventional deep learning approaches for detection and close to that of conventional deep learning approaches for classification.

AB  - Bone marrow examination plays an important role in the diagnosis of a number of diseases, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, etc. However, the examination is slowed down by complicated manual work which requires professional knowledge. In this paper, deep learning methods are applied in bio-medical field to detect and count different types of cells in an automatic way instead of manual work in bone marrow examination. The process is mainly composed of two steps, segmentation and classification. Double backbone networks structure is employed to show better result. A two-step training strategy is also proposed. Mask-Region-Convolutional Neural Networks(Mask-RCNN) was used for detection and image segmentation to extract cells and then common architectures in convolutional neural networks pre-trained on ImageNet, such as Dense Convolutional Network and Deep Residual Network(ResNet), were fully experimented and compared in classification. Result of the first stage shows high efficiency to meet application requirements. For cell classification, InceptionV3 shew the best precision of 93% in five cell lines and ResNet-152 achieved 82% in twelve classes. This structure improves nearly three times of accuracy of a single Mask-RCNN.

In this study, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) method was used to increase the number of samples belonged to a medical data set (White Blood Cells) that containing a small number of images. Accurate learning of the specific characteristics of both the data and classes allowed the classification success to be maximized.

While a manual systematical analysis can be too time consuming, a fully automatic search is very dependent on the kind of hyper-parameters. For a cell classification network, we assess the individual effects of a large number of hyper-parameters and compare the resulting choice of hyperparameters with state of the art search techniques. We further propose an approach for automated, successive search space reduction that yields well performing sets of hyperparameters in a time-efficient way.

AB  - Analysis of the blood cell distribution in bone marrow is necessary for a detailed diagnosis of many hematopoietic diseases, such as leukemia. While this task is performed manually on microscope images in clinical routine, automating it could improve reliability and objectivity. Cell detection tasks in medical imaging have successfully been solved using deep learning, in particular with RetinaNet, a powerful network architecture that yields good detection results in this scenario. It utilizes axis-parallel, rectangular bounding boxes to describe an object's position and size. However, since cells are mostly circular, this is suboptimal. We replace RetinaNet's anchors with more suitable Circular Anchors, which cover the shape of cells more precisely. We further introduce an extension to the Non-maximum Suppression algorithm that copes with predictions that differ in size. Experiments on hematopoietic cells in bone marrow images show that these methods reduce the number of false positive predictions and increase detection accuracy.

AB  - Accurate diagnosis and classification of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) requires integration of clinical, morphological, and genetic findings. Despite major advances in our understanding of the molecular and genetic basis of MPNs, the morphological assessment of bone marrow trephines (BMT) is critical in differentiating MPN subtypes and their reactive mimics. However, morphological assessment is heavily constrained by a reliance on subjective, qualitative, and poorly reproducible criteria. To improve the morphological assessment of MPNs, we have developed a machine learning approach for the automated identification, quantitative analysis, and abstract representation of megakaryocyte features using reactive/nonneoplastic BMT samples (n = 43) and those from patients with established diagnoses of essential thrombocythemia (n = 45), polycythemia vera (n = 18), or myelofibrosis (n = 25). We describe the application of an automated workflow for the identification and delineation of relevant histological features from routinely prepared BMTs. Subsequent analysis enabled the tissue diagnosis of MPN with a high predictive accuracy (area under the curve = 0.95) and revealed clear evidence of the potential to discriminate between important MPN subtypes. Our method of visually representing abstracted megakaryocyte features in the context of analyzed patient cohorts facilitates the interpretation and monitoring of samples in a manner that is beyond conventional approaches. The automated BMT phenotyping approach described here has significant potential as an adjunct to standard genetic and molecular testing in established or suspected MPN patients, either as part of the routine diagnostic pathway or in the assessment of disease progression/response to treatment.

AB  - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major problem in people's lives. At present, the most widespread detection method is mainly manual, which is time-consuming and laborious. With the development of deep learning, specifically targeting the complexity of traditional convolutional neural network models, substantial resource costs, and non-conducive deployment. This paper proposes a simple and effective classification method. The use of lightweight convolutional neural network classified microscopic images of acute leukemia can more effectively assist doctors in the diagnosis of diseases. The method is evaluated in C-NMC 2019 data set and achieves an accuracy rate is 86.29%, F1 coefficient is 89.98%, and a recall rate of an astonishing 95.73% on the test set. Meanwhile, the model parameters are one ninth of those in the traditional convolution neural network. On the premise of ensuring high accuracy, this paper discuss that reduced complexity of the model, the facilitation of deployment and application of the model in the mobile terminal and the potential to help doctors to carry out auxiliary diagnosis of diseases with the help of portable instruments or modern equipment.

AB  - Automated nucleus/cell detection is usually considered as the basis and a critical prerequisite step of computer assisted pathology and microscopy image analysis. However, due to the enormous variability (cell types, stains and different microscopes) and data complexity (cell overlapping, inhomogeneous intensities, background clutters and image artifacts), robust and accurate nucleus/cell detection is usually a difficult problem. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-scale fully convolutional neural networks approach for regression of a density map to robustly detect the nuclei of pathology and microscopy images. The procedure can be divided into three main stages. Initially, instead of working on the simple dot label space, regression on the proposed structured proximity space for patches is performed so that centers of image patches are explicitly forced to produce larger values than their adjacent areas. Then, several multi-scale fully convolutional regression networks are developed for this task; this will enlarge the receptive field and not only can detect the single, small size cells, but also benefit to detecting cells with big size and overlapping states. In this stage, we copy the full feature maps from the contracting path and merge with the feature maps of the expansive path. This operation will make full use of shallow and deep semantic information of the networks. The networks do not have any fully connected layers; this strategy allows the seamless probability map prediction of arbitrarily large images. At the same time, data augmentations (e.g., small range shift, zoom and randomly flip) are carefully used to enhance the robustness of detection. Finally, morphological operations and suitable filters are employed and some prior information is introduced to find the centers of the cells more robustly. Our method achieves about 99.25% detection precision and the F1-measure is 0.9924 on fluorescence microscopy cell images; about 85.90% detection precision and the F1-measure is 0.9020 on Lymphocyte cell images and about 78.41% detection precision and the F1-measure is 0.8440 on breast histopathological images. This result leads to a promising detection performance that equates and sometimes exceeds the recently published leading detection approaches with the same benchmark datasets.

AB  - Accurately counting the number of cells in microscopy images is required in many medical diagnosis and biological studies. This task is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to subjective errors. However, designing automatic counting methods remains challenging due to low image contrast, complex background, large variance in cell shapes and counts, and significant cell occlusions in two-dimensional microscopy images. In this study, we proposed a new density regression-based method for automatically counting cells in microscopy images. The proposed method processes two innovations compared to other state-of-the-art density regression-based methods. First, the density regression model (DRM) is designed as a concatenated fully convolutional regression network (C-FCRN) to employ multi-scale image features for the estimation of cell density maps from given images. Second, auxiliary convolutional neural networks (AuxCNNs) are employed to assist in the training of intermediate layers of the designed C-FCRN to improve the DRM performance on unseen datasets. Experimental studies evaluated on four datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

AB  - The diagnosis of blood-related diseases involves the identification and characterization of a patient's blood sample. As such, automated methods for detecting and classifying the types of blood cells have important medical applications in this field. Although deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and the traditional machine learning methods have shown good results in the classification of blood cell images, they are unable to fully exploit the long-term dependence relationship between certain key features of images and image labels. To resolve this problem, we have introduced the recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Specifically, we combined the CNN and RNN in order to propose the CNN-RNN framework that can deepen the understanding of image content and learn the structured features of images and to begin endto-end training of big data in medical image analysis. In particular, we apply the transfer learning method to transfer the weight parameters that were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to the CNN section and adopted a custom loss function to allow our network to train and converge faster and with more accurate weight parameters. Experimental results show that compared with the other CNN models such as ResNet and Inception V3, our proposed network model is more accurate and efficient in classifying blood cell images.

AB  - Leukemia is a fatal cancer and has two main types: Acute and chronic. Each type has two more subtypes: Lymphoid and myeloid. Hence, in total, there are four subtypes of leukemia. This study proposes a new approach for diagnosis of all subtypes of leukemia from microscopic blood cell images using convolutional neural networks (CNN), which requires a large training data set. Therefore, we also investigated the effects of data augmentation for an increasing number of training samples synthetically. We used two publicly available leukemia data sources: ALL-IDB and ASH Image Bank. Next, we applied seven different image transformation techniques as data augmentation. We designed a CNN architecture capable of recognizing all subtypes of leukemia. Besides, we also explored other well-known machine learning algorithms such as naive Bayes, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and decision tree. To evaluate our approach, we set up a set of experiments and used 5-fold cross-validation. The results we obtained from experiments showed that our CNN model performance has 88.25% and 81.74% accuracy, in leukemia versus healthy and multiclass classification of all subtypes, respectively. Finally, we also showed that the CNN model has a better performance than other wellknown machine learning algorithms.

AB  - The classification of white blood cells is critical for the diagnosis of anemia, leukemia and many other hematologic diseases. Current approaches are mainly based on traditional machine learning methods, which take quite a noticeable time and the recognition error rate is relatively high especially for the rare kinds of leukocytes. In this paper, we develop an automatic cell recognition system by applying deep learning methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed system performs well in the leukocytes recognition task with less hardware limitations and higher accuracy compared to the traditional ones.

AB  - Reliable cell segmentation and classification from biomedical images is a crucial step for both scientific research and clinical practice. A major challenge for more robust segmentation and classification methods is the large variations in the size, shape and viewpoint of the cells, combining with the low image quality caused by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, in this work we propose a learning-based, simultaneous cell segmentation and classification method based on the deep U-Net structure with deformable convolution layers. The U-Net architecture for deep learning has been shown to offer a precise localization for image semantic segmentation. Moreover, deformable convolution layer enables the free form deformation of the feature learning process, thus makes the whole network more robust to various cell morphologies and image settings. The proposed method is tested on microscopic red blood cell images from patients with sickle cell disease. The results show that U-Net with deformable convolution achieves the highest accuracy for segmentation and classification, comparing with original U-Net structure.

AB  - Differential blood count is a very common medical test which determines relative percentage of each type of white blood cell (WBC) in a blood sample. This test is usually performed by visual inspection of a blood sample which is time consuming and tedious task for a medical specialist. This test can be performed automatically with appropriate equipment as well. However, such equipment is quite expensive and available only at larger medical centers. In this paper alternative approach is proposed which is based on low cost microscope and digital camera coupled with appropriate algorithm for WBCs detection and identification in a blood image. The proposed algorithm consists of two steps. An image of blood sample is segmented in order to detect possible WBCs which are then further classified with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) into 5 classes. The proposed approach shows promising results obtaining accuracy of 81.11% on created dataset.

AB  - This paper concerns automated cell counting and detection in microscopy images. The approach we take is to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to regress a cell spatial density map across the image. This is applicable to situations where traditional single-cell segmentation-based methods do not work well due to cell clumping or overlaps. We make the following contributions: (i) we develop and compare architectures for two fully convolutional regression networks (FCRNs) for this task; (ii) since the networks are fully convolutional, they can predict a density map for an input image of arbitrary size, and we exploit this to improve efficiency by end-to-end training on image patches; (iii) we show that FCRNs trained entirely on synthetic data are able to give excellent predictions on microscopy images from real biological experiments without fine-tuning, and that the performance can be further improved by fine-tuning on these real images. Finally, (iv) by inverting feature representations, we show to what extent the information from an input image has been encoded by feature responses in different layers. We set a new state-of-the-art performance for cell counting on standard synthetic image benchmarks and show that the FCRNs trained entirely with synthetic data can generalise well to real microscopy images both for cell counting and detections for the case of overlapping cells.

AB  - White blood cells (WBCs) are the cells of immune system, protecting against infective diseases and invasion of viruses and bacteria. Their aberrant number, both abnormal increase and decrease, is a sign of an ongoing pathology, a precise evaluation of their number is of the utmost importance as the first step of assessing a potential disease. In blood cell microscopic images, since red blood cells and platelets are similar in color with WBCs, and WBCs are partially adhesive, WBC segmentation for counting is often not resulting in a good performance. Therefore, in this work, a color space transformation is proposed to filter out red blood cells and platelets, which is transforming the blood cell microscopic images of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia from RGB color space to HSV to detect and extract WBCs. For precisely segmenting adhesive WBCs in extraction results, we set cell border to the third class, in addition to foreground and background. A weighted cross-entropy loss function based on class weight and distance transformation weight enhanced U-Net to learn cell border features. Our results showed that the method proposed in this paper for WBC segmentation using the data set ALL_IDB1 could achieve an accuracy of 97.92%.

AB  - Detection of dysmorphic cells in peripheral blood (PB) smears is essential in diagnostic screening of hematological diseases. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are hematopoietic neoplasms characterized by dysplastic and ineffective hematopoiesis, which diagnosis is mainly based on morphological findings of PB and bone marrow. We developed an automated diagnostic support system of MDS by combining an automated blood cell image-recognition system using a deep learning system (DLS) powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a decision-making system using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The DLS of blood cell image-recognition has been trained using datasets consisting of 695,030 blood cell images taken from 3,261 PB smears including hematopoietic malignancies. The DLS simultaneously classified 17 blood cell types and 97 morphological features of such cells with >93.5% sensitivity and >96.0% specificity. The automated MDS diagnostic system successfully differentiated MDS from aplastic anemia (AA) with high accuracy; 96.2% of sensitivity and 100% of specificity (AUC 0.990). This is the first CNN-based automated initial diagnostic system for MDS using PB smears, which is applicable to develop new automated diagnostic systems for various hematological disorders.

AB  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are typically trained in the RGB color space. However, in medical imaging, we believe that pixel stain quantities offer a fundamental view of the interaction between tissues and stain chemicals. Since the optical density (OD) colorspace allows to compute pixel stain quantities from pixel RGB intensities using the Beer-Lambert’s law, we propose a stain deconvolutional layer, hereby named as SD-Layer, affixed at the front of CNN that performs two functions: (1) it transforms the input RGB microscopic images to Optical Density (OD) space and (2) this layer deconvolves OD image with the stain basis learned through backpropagation and provides tissue-specific stain absorption quantities as input to the following CNN layers. With the introduction of only nine additional learnable parameters in the proposed SD-Layer, we obtain a considerably improved performance on two standard CNN architectures: AlexNet and T-CNN. Using the T-CNN architecture prefixed with the proposed SD-Layer, we obtain 5-fold cross-validation accuracy of 93.2% in the problem of differentiating malignant immature White Blood Cells (WBCs) from normal immature WBCs for cancer detection.

AB  - Analysis of hematopoietic cells in bone marrow images is a newly emerging field in computer vision. Deep neural networks provide promising approaches for detection and classification tasks in this field. However, labelling a sufficiently large amount of images by medical experts is infeasible in practice. This can be resolved by semi-supervised methods that use image reconstruction as a way to incorporate images without labelled cells. However, this inevitably leads to an inclusion of surrounding cells into the learned representation. We propose and analyze several techniques for reducing their influence and show that this improves classification results of unsupervisedly learned cell representations.

AB  - The analysis of cells in bone marrow microscopy images is essential for the diagnosis of many hematopoietic diseases such as leukemia. Automating detection, classification and quantification of different types of leukocytes in whole slide images could improve throughput and reliability. However, variations in the staining agent used to highlight cell features can reduce the accuracy of these methods. In histopathology, data augmentation and normalization techniques are used to make neural networks more robust but their application to hematological image data needs to be investigated. In this paper, we compare six promising approaches on three image sets with different staining characteristics in terms of detection and classification.

AB  - While providing powerful solutions for many problems, deep neural networks require large amounts of training data. In medical image computing, this is a severe limitation, as the required expertise makes annotation efforts often infeasible. This also applies to the automated analysis of hematopoietic cells in bone marrow whole slide images. In this work, we propose approaches to restrict a neural network towards learning of rotation invariant or equivariant representation. Even though the proposed methods achieve this goal, it does not increase classification scores on unsupervisedly learned representations.

AB  - Classification of normal and malignant cells observed under a microscope is an essential and challenging step in the development of a cost-effective computer-aided diagnosis tool for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this paper, we propose the neighborhood-correction algorithm (NCA) to address this challenge, which consists of three major steps, including (1) fine-tuning a pretrained residual network using training data and producing initial labels and feature maps for test data, (2) constructing a Fisher vector for each cell image based on its feature maps, and (3) correcting the initial label of each test cell image via the weighted majority voting based on its most similar neighbors. We have evaluated this algorithm on the database provided by the grand challenge on the classification of normal and malignant cells (C-NMC) in B-ALL white blood cancer microscopic images. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed NCA achieves the weighted F1-score of 92.50% and balanced accuracy of 91.73% in the preliminary testing and achieves weighted F1-score of 91.04% in the final testing, which ranks the first in C-NMC.

AB  - Red blood cells are highly deformable and present in various shapes. In blood cell disorders, only a subset of all cells is morphologically altered and relevant for the diagnosis. However, manually labeling of all cells is laborious, complicated and introduces inter-expert variability. We propose an attention based multiple instance learning method to classify blood samples of patients suffering from blood cell disorders. Cells are detected using an R-CNN architecture. With the features extracted for each cell, a multiple instance learning method classifies patient samples into one out of four blood cell disorders. The attention mechanism provides a measure of the contribution of each cell to the overall classification and significantly improves the networks classification accuracy as well as its interpretability for the medical expert.

AB  - Reliable cell segmentation and classification from biomedical images is a crucial step for both scientific research and clinical practice. A major challenge for more robust segmentation and classification methods is the large variations in the size, shape and viewpoint of the cells, combining with the low image quality caused by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, in this work we propose a learning-based, simultaneous cell segmentation and classification method based on the U-Net structure with deformable convolution layers. The U-Net architecture has been shown to offer a precise localization for image semantic segmentation. Moreover, deformable convolution enables the free form deformation of the feature learning process, thus making the whole network more robust to various cell morphologies and image settings. The proposed method is tested on microscopic red blood cell images from patients with sickle cell disease. The results show that U-Net with deformable convolution achieves the highest accuracy for both segmentation and classification tasks, compared with the original U-Net structure and unsupervised methods.

AB  - A CNN-based framework is built to automatically classify the blood cell images into subtypes of the cells, and the results show that the proposed model provide better results in terms of evaluation parameters. Abstract Deep Learning has already shown power in many application fields, and is accepted by more and more people as a better approach than the traditional machine learning models. In particular, the implementation of deep learning algorithms, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), brings huge benefits to the medical field, where a huge number of images are to be processed and analyzed. This paper aims to develop a deep learning model to address the blood cell classification problem, which is one of the most challenging problems in blood diagnosis. A CNN-based framework is built to automatically classify the blood cell images into subtypes of the cells. Experiments are conducted on a dataset of 13k images of blood cells with their subtypes, and the results show that our proposed model provide better results in terms of evaluation parameters.
