Analyzing human biological samples such as blood, has become essential for physicians to diagnose and follow diseases evolution. Traditional blood cells counting techniques used in laboratories are time consuming and laborious. They can lead to inaccurate results due to the human intervention in this complicated process. In this paper, we propose an automated blood cells counting framework using convolutional neural network (CNN), instance segmentation, transfer learning, and mask R-CNN techniques. Red and white blood cells are identified, classified, and counted from microscopic blood smear images. The obtained results reveal highly detection rate of different blood cells. In addition, unlike other state-of-the-art techniques, our proposed method has the ability to identify overlapped and faded cells.","2019-12","2021-01-29 18:54:45","2021-01-29 18:54:45","","300-303","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\UIQXXUBY\Dhieb et al. - 2019 - An Automated Blood Cells Counting and Classificati.pdf; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\HSZFNFJD\9021862.html","","","automated blood cells; biomedical optical imaging; blood; Blood; Cells (biology); Cells counting; cellular biophysics; classification framework; convolutional neural nets; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diseases; diseases evolution; Feature extraction; health care; healthcare applications; human biological samples; image classification; image segmentation; Image segmentation; instance segmentation; learning (artificial intelligence); Machine learning; mask R-CNN; medical image processing; microscopic blood smear images; Microscopy; object detection; R-CNN deep learning model; R-CNN techniques; traditional blood cells; transfer learning; white blood cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 31st International Conference on Microelectronics (ICM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to build an automated, efficient and rapid leukemia diagnosis system. We demonstrate that it is possible to improve the precision of current techniques from the literature using the description power of well-known Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We extract features from a blood smear image using pre-trained CNNs in order to obtain an unique image description. Many feature selection techniques were evaluated and we chose PCA to select the features that are in the final descriptor. To classify the images on healthy and pathological we created an ensemble of classifiers with three individual classification algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron and Random Forest). In the tests we obtained an accuracy rate of 100%. Besides the high accuracy rate, the tests showed that our approach requires less processing time than the methods analyzed in this paper, considering the fact that our approach does not use segmentation to obtain specific cell regions from the blood smear image.","2017-10","2021-01-29 19:15:04","2021-01-29 19:15:04","","367-373","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2377-5416","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\BIITVZA5\8097335.html; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\ND75XUMZ\Vogado et al. - 2017 - Diagnosing Leukemia in Blood Smear Images Using an.pdf","","","blood; Blood; blood smear image; cancer; computer-aided diagnosis; convolutional neural networks; disease; diseases; Diseases; ensemble classifiers; feature extraction; Feature extraction; feature selection; image classification; Image color analysis; image description; image segmentation; Image segmentation; learning (artificial intelligence); leukemia; leukemia diagnosis system; medical image processing; multilayer perceptron; multilayer perceptrons; neural nets; Neural networks; pretrained CNN; pretrained convolutional neural networks; random forest; support vector machine; support vector machines; Support vector machines; transfer learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 30th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose a novel pipeline for red blood cell detection and counting in thin blood smear microscopy images, named RBCNet, using a dual deep learning architecture. RBCNet consists of a U-Net first stage for cell-cluster segmentation, followed by a second stage Faster R-CNN for detecting small cell objects within clusters, identified as connected components from the U-Net stage. RBCNet uses cell clustering instead of region proposals, which is robust to cell fragmentation, is highly scalable for detecting small objects or fine scale morphological structures in very large images, can be trained using non-overlapping tiles, and during inference is adaptive to the scale of cell-clusters with a low memory footprint. We tested our method on an archived collection of human malaria smears with nearly 200,000 labeled cells across 965 images from 193 patients, acquired in Bangladesh, with each patient contributing five images. Cell detection accuracy using RBCNet was higher than 97%. The novel dual cascade RBCNet architecture provides more accurate cell detections because the foreground cell-cluster masks from U-Net adaptively guide the detection stage, resulting in a notably higher true positive and lower false alarm rates, compared to traditional and other deep learning methods. The RBCNet pipeline implements a crucial step towards automated malaria diagnosis.","2020","2021-01-29 19:21:06","2021-01-29 19:21:06","","1-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\LWFLRS9Z\9244549.html; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\DB737IG3\Kassim et al. - 2020 - Clustering-Based Dual Deep Learning Architecture f.pdf","","","Blood; Computer architecture; Connected components; Deep learning; Diseases; Faster R-CNN; Image segmentation; Microprocessors; Pipelines; Red blood cells (RBCs); Semantic segmentation; Superpixel; U-Net; White blood cells (WBCs)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed review’s main impact is to find the most suitable TML and DL techniques in MIA, especially for leukocyte classification in blood smear images. The advanced DL techniques, particularly the evolving convolutional neural networks-based models in the MIA domain, are deeply investigated in this review article. The related literature study reveals that mainstream TML methods are vastly applied to microscopic blood smear images for white blood cells (WBC) analysis. They provide valuable information to medical specialists and help diagnose various hematic diseases such as AIDS and blood cancer (Leukaemia).

Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a blood cancer mostly found in children below the age of 7-8 years. It can be fatal if left untreated. ALL cells are abnormal lymphocytes that have a condensed appearance to their chromatin. ALL can be detected through the analysis of white blood cells (WBCs) also called as leukocytes. Presently the morphological analysis of blood cells is performed manually by skilled operators, which makes it a time-taking and non-standardized process. This paper presents a novel deep learning approach to automate the process of detecting ALL from whole-slide blood smear images. Previous work in this domain deal with the isolation and classification of WBCs based on certain morphological image features. However, this work uses a deep network for simultaneous localization and classification of WBCs. The network makes use of Average Pooling layers to figure out the hot-spots of WBC locations in whole-slide images. Although this workflow fails to successfully figure out all the ALL lymphocytes in a whole-slide image, but it does performs very well in the task of predicting whether the blood smear image belongs to an ALL patient or not.","2017-12","2021-01-29 19:52:15","2021-01-29 19:52:15","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\HR7W4JR9\Ghosh et al. - 2017 - Simultaneous localization and classification of ac.pdf; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\FPS9CTYJ\8300425.html","","","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute lymphoblastic leukemic cells; age 7 year to 8 year; ALL cells; average pooling layer; blood; Blood; blood cancer; blood smear image; Bones; cancer; Cancer; Cells (biology); cellular biophysics; deep CNN; deep convolutional network; deep learning approach; digital pathology; diseases; feature extraction; Heating systems; image classification; image segmentation; Image segmentation; learning (artificial intelligence); localization; medical image processing; morphological image features; peripheral blood; Training; white blood cells; whole-slide blood; whole-slide image","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 IEEE International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems (ICIIS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is used to help experts or medical practitioner as a second opinion to analyze the blood smear image. It is done manually by some practitioners but it is time consuming and creates confusion as different pathologists give different observations and results as it is highly dependent on the experts' skills. Other than that, it is also challenging to analyze it manually as there are thousands of images. Some researchers used CAS by applying the machine learning to classify the data. However, significant features must be known before proceeding with classification process. In this paper, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied to classify the WBC types to identify Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). It is a better approach as no complex features need to be designed and it is a fast response program. Pre-trained models of deep learning which are AlexNet, GoogleNet and VGG-16 are compared to each other to find the model that can classify better. There are 260 images in IDB-2 database and 242 images in LISC database. Five types of WBC are classified for LISC database while for IDB-2 database, Lymphoblast and Non-Lymphoblast is classified specifically. As a result, for both database, AlexNet achieve the best result in terms of the training and testing accuracy for each class. Training accuracy for IDB-2 is 96.15% while testing accuracy for Lymphoblast and Non-Lymphoblast is 97.74% and 95.29% respectively. Training accuracy by AlexNet for LISC is 80.82% and testing accuracy is the highest for each class except Monocyte.

The answer to prevent and protect ourselves from the diseases threatening our life lies at the microscopic level in our own blood. Blood consists of erythrocytes (RBCs), lymphocytes (WBCs) and platelets. Object detection is one of the many technologies which can help determine the different constituents of blood. It is a computer technology which deals with object occurrences of pre-defined classes such as cars, humans, buildings, etc. And has far-reaching applications such as self-driven cars, face recognition, face detection, etc. For object detection to be applicable in real-life situations, it should be fast and efficient in determining various entities in an image. There are many object detection techniques developed to make it more efficacious such as CNN and the family of R-CNN. In our research, we apply Faster R-CNN to the Blood Cell Count and Detection dataset to detect RBCs, WBCs, and Platelets. The number, shape and other meta-information or in other words any anomaly in the different constituents of blood can help in early detection of a wide array of issues and/or diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, sickle cell disease, etc. Our model detects a bounding box on the three blood constituents with a justifiable accuracy.

However, detecting early stage Leukemia, i.e, finding a small amount of blood cells among massive normal cells, is both technically challenge and labor intensive. Therefore, we designed an AI-powered diagnoser for precise identification of white blood cells. The precise identification has two steps, blood image collecting and cell classification. First, with the help of doctors in Ruijing Hospital, we have been collecting about 1,000 high-quality labeled blood cell samples each week and accumulated more than 200,000 samples in total. This is the largest blood cell image dataset for leukemia in China.

Complete blood count test (CBC) is the common process for measuring these characteristic changes. However, the CBC test cannot be completely relied upon since there are chances of false diagnosis as these characteristics are also related to other disorders. In order to rectify the same, other expensive and lengthy tests need to be done which leads to further delay in accurate diagnosis and which may prove detrimental. In an attempt to find the solution to this problem, this paper proposes a method that uses feature fusion for classification of microcytic hypochromia. Feature fusion means combining blood smear image features extracted by the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and clinical features from CBC test. This fused data-set is further used to predict microcytic hypochromia. After obtaining fused data set we use linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce data set dimensions which further results in less computational overhead. To differentiate between microcytic hypochromia patients and normal persons, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network classification models are used. In order to check the performance of the above model, various evaluation metrics are used. Results achieved from the proposed method reflect that fused data set can effectively improve the identification ratio with a very limited number of patients diagnostic images and clinical data (10 for normal and 10 for β-thalassemia) and feed-forward back-propagation neural network on this data set achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99%, 1.00, and 0.98, respectively.

Recently, semantic segmentation is a breakthrough in biomedical image segmentation. Semantic segmentation is the process of classifying each and every pixel of an image into a class. This paper explicitly deals with various semantic segmentation methods applied to different biomedical images. Further, diverse architectures of deep neural networks for semantic segmentation of images such as U-Net, fully convolution network (FCN), and SegNet are examined.

This paper presents an automated diagnostic system to detect acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The model uses labeled microscopic blood smear images to detect the malignant leukaemia cells. The current work uses data obtained from the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Image DataBase (ALL_IDB) and performs various data augmentation techniques to increase the number of training data which in effect reduces the over-training problem. The model has been trained on 515 images using a fivefold validation technique achieving an accuracy of 95.54% and further tested on the remaining 221 images achieving almost 100% accuracy during most of the trials, maintaining an average of 99.5% accuracy.

This is due to imbalanced dataset, intra-class compactness, inter-class separability and overfitting problems. The main research idea is to enhance the classification and prediction accuracy of blood images while lowering processing time through the use of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architecture by using the modified loss function.  The proposed system consists of a deep neural convolution network (DCNN) that will improve the classification accuracy by using modified loss function along with regularization. Firstly, images are pre-processed and fed through DCNN that contains different layers with different activation function for the feature extraction and classification. Along with modified loss function with regularization, weight function aids in the classification of WBCs by considering weights of samples belonging to each class for compensating the error arising due to imbalanced dataset. The processing time will be counted by each image to check the time enhancement.  The classification accuracy and processing time are achieved using the dataset-master. Our proposed solution obtains better classification performance in the given dataset comparing with other previous methods. The proposed system enhanced the classification accuracy of 98.92% from 96.1% and a decrease in processing time from 0.354 to 0.216 s. Less time will be required by our proposed solution for achieving the model convergence with 9 epochs against the current convergence time of 13.5 epochs on average, epoch is the formation white blood cells (WBCs) and the development of granular cells.

The task of diagnosing Leukemia is time consuming and tedious for doctors; it is also challenging to determine the level and type of Leukemia. The diagnoses of Leukemia are achieved through identifying the changes on the White blood Cells (WBC). WBCs are divided into five types: Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Basophils, Monocytes, and Lymphocytes. In this paper, the authors propose a Convolutional Neural Network to detect and classify normal white blood cells. The program will learn about the shape and type of normal WBC by performing the following two tasks. The first task is identifying high level features of a normal white blood cell. The second task is classifying the normal white blood cell according to its type. Using a Convolutional Neural Network CNN, the system will be able to detect normal WBCs by comparing them with the high-level features of normal WBC. This process of identifying and classifying WBC can be vital for doctors and medical staff to make a decision.

Thus, accurate and automatic segmentation of leukocyte from blood smear images is a fundamental task. To achieve this task, we proposed an end-to-end peripheral blood leukocyte segmentation method based on deep convolutional neural networks, where the encoder-decoder network is its basic structure. Specifically, the proposed method first utilizes the feature encoder to extract multi-scale leukocyte features. Then, the context-aware feature decoder is introduced to reconstruct the segmentation mask of leukocyte. Finally, each layer generates a prediction map in the decoder module, and all these prediction maps are averaged to be the final prediction map. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed qualitative and quantitative comparisons with several existing methods on two publicly available datasets and a private dataset. Experimental results validate that the proposed method is superior for peripheral blood leukocyte image segmentation in terms of accuracy and robustness.","2020","2021-02-25 13:59:04","2021-02-25 13:59:04","","464-473","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\I5WMEMPT\Chen et al. - 2020 - Peripheral Blood Leukocyte Image Segmentation Base.pdf","","","Deep neural network; Feature extraction; Image segmentation; Leukocyte","Chen, Xiaofeng; Yan, Hongyang; Yan, Qiben; Zhang, Xiangliang","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A big challenge to deep learning model is the accuracy drop when facing image corruptions caused by different smear preparation and digitalization operations. In order to serve the real applications of peripheral blood analysis, a practical deep learning classifier needs to be robust against a wide range of corruptions. In this paper, we first investigate the comprehensive corruption types for peripheral blood smear image and establish the benchmark dataset Smear-C simulating the real physical cause factors. Then we propose a novel method SmearRobust which can easily fit into the existing neural networks and improve the robustness.

A manual differential technique, that is often used to get authentic count and abnormalities present in a stained blood smear, requires a lot of human expertise and time. Dedicated efforts are given to make the classification and counting process of blood profiles automatic and robust. In this paper, first, we build a neural network-based multiclass classifier that can classify between RBC, WBC, and platelets. However, we demonstrate that the presence of a small amount of random noise can drastically decrease the performance of the designed classifier. Thus, we design a preprocessing network to enhance the quality of the input image so that the classifier can faithfully classify the blood cells even in adverse imaging conditions.","2020","2021-02-25 13:59:27","2021-02-25 13:59:27","","195-200","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems","","","","Springer","Singapore","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\QWW5WHF7\Ghosh und Bhattacharya - 2020 - Classification of RBC and WBC in Noisy Microscopic.pdf","","","Denoising; Enhancement; RBC; WBC","Mandal, Jyotsna Kumar; Bhattacharya, Kallol; Majumdar, Ivy; Mandal, Surajit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it remains difficult to accurately segment and identify leukocytes under variable imaging conditions, such as variable light conditions and staining degrees, the presence of dyeing impurities, and large variations in cell appearances, e.g., size, color, and shape of cells. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end leukocyte segmentation algorithm that uses pixel-level prior information for supervised training of a deep convolutional neural network. Specifically, a context-aware feature encoder is first introduced to extract multi-scale leukocyte features. Then, a feature refinement module based on the residual network is designed to extract more discriminative features. Finally, a finer segmentation mask of leukocytes is reconstructed by a feature decoded based on the feature maps. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons of real-world datasets show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art leukocyte segmentation performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness.","2019","2021-02-25 14:00:25","2021-02-25 14:00:25","","191-200","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\EEKFU62T\Lu et al. - 2019 - Leukocyte Segmentation via End-to-End Learning of .pdf","","","Cell segmentation; Deep convolutional neural networks; Feature refinement; Leukocytes","Cui, Zhen; Pan, Jinshan; Zhang, Shanshan; Xiao, Liang; Yang, Jian","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, we find that current approaches look to either segment objects or count them through bounding boxes, and those methodologies that both segment and count struggle with co-located and overlapping objects. This restricts our capabilities when, for example, we require the area covered by particular objects as well as the number of those objects present, especially when we have a large amount of images to obtain this information for. In this paper, we address this by proposing a Dual-Output U-Net. DO-U-Net is an Encoder-Decoder style, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) for object segmentation and counting in image processing. Our proposed architecture achieves precision and sensitivity superior to other, similar models by producing two target outputs: a segmentation mask and an edge mask. Two case studies are used to demonstrate the capabilities of DO-U-Net: locating and counting Internally Displaced People (IDP) tents in satellite imagery, and the segmentation and counting of erythrocytes in blood smears. The model was demonstrated to work with a relatively small training dataset, achieving a sensitivity of 98.69% for IDP camps of the fixed resolution, and 94.66% for a scale-invariant IDP model. DO-U-Net achieved a sensitivity of 99.07% on the erythrocytes dataset. DO-U-Net has a reduced memory footprint, allowing for training and deployment on a machine with a lower to mid-range GPU, making it accessible to a wider audience, including non-governmental organisations (NGOs) providing humanitarian aid, as well as health care organisations.","2020","2021-02-25 17:42:52","2021-02-25 17:42:52","","391-403","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\RLFZGYU8\Overton und Tucker - 2020 - DO-U-Net for Segmentation and Counting.pdf","","","Blood smear; Convolutional neural networks; Counting; Satellite imagery; Segmentation; U-Net","Berthold, Michael R.; Feelders, Ad; Krempl, Georg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So far, several attempts have been made using custom image features and prior knowledge in form of cytoplasm and nuclei segmentations or a restricted number of cell types in peripheral blood. Instead of hand-crafting features and classification methods for bone marrow images, we compare several well-known methods on our more challenging dataset and we show that while generic classical machine learning approaches cannot compete with specialized algorithms, even out-of-the-box deep learning methods already yield valuable results.

While deep learning models are widely adopted in image recognition and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, deep learning models in their vanilla form do not provide an estimate of prediction uncertainty. This is especially problematic when there is a high discrepancy between training and testing data such as in blood smear images where subject level variability and sample noise from staining and illumination are non-negligible. To address these issues, we propose a novel ensemble method by weighting each base model according to its respective predictive confidence obtained from Monte Carlo dropout. Our ensemble method can effectively prevent overfitting and increases classification performance compared to any single model result. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model’s ability to identify samples that do not fall in the training data distribution.

For natural images object annotation is easy and cheap. For biomedical images however, annotation crucially depends on the availability of a trained expert whose time is typically expensive and scarce. To ensure efficient annotation, only the most relevant objects should be presented to the expert. Currently, no approach exists that allows to select those for a multiclass detection problem. Here, we present an active learning framework that identifies the most relevant samples from a large set of not annotated data for further expert annotation. Applied to brightfield images of red blood cells with seven subtypes, we train a faster R-CNN for single cell identification and classification, calculate a novel confidence score using dropout variational inference and select relevant images for annotation based on (i) the confidence of the single cell detection and (ii) the rareness of the classes contained in the image. We show that our approach leads to a drastic increase of prediction accuracy with already few annotated images. Our original approach improves classification of red blood cell subtypes and speeds up the annotation.

In contrast to traditional learning, in which no knowledge is retained that can be transferred from one model to another, our proposed algorithm uses deep learning approach for segmentation and classification. The proposed algorithm has two-stage pipelining consisting of semantic segmentation and transfer learning-based classification.

In many regions, particularly those in resource-limited settings, SCD is not consistently diagnosed. In Africa, where the majority of SCD patients reside, more than 50% of the 0.2-0.3 million children born with SCD each year will die from it; many of these deaths are in fact preventable with correct diagnosis and treatment. Here, we present a deep learning framework which can perform automatic screening of sickle cells in blood smears using a smartphone microscope. This framework uses two distinct, complementary deep neural networks. The first neural network enhances and standardizes the blood smear images captured by the smartphone microscope, spatially and spectrally matching the image quality of a laboratory-grade benchtop microscope. The second network acts on the output of the first image enhancement neural network and is used to perform the semantic segmentation between healthy and sickle cells within a blood smear. These segmented images are then used to rapidly determine the SCD diagnosis per patient. We blindly tested this mobile sickle cell detection method using blood smears from 96 unique patients (including 32 SCD patients) that were imaged by our smartphone microscope, and achieved ~98% accuracy, with an area-under-the-curve of 0.998. With its high accuracy, this mobile and cost-effective method has the potential to be used as a screening tool for SCD and other blood cell disorders in resource-limited settings.","2020","2021-02-27 11:22:53","2021-02-27 11:22:53","","76","","","3","","NPJ Digit Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32509973 PMCID: PMC7244537","","; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\RGYNH5IK\de Haan et al. - 2020 - Automated screening of sickle cells using a smartp.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32509973","","Diagnosis; Haematological diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current developed automated cell morphology equipments perform differential count which is based on blood smear image analysis. Previous identification systems for WBCs consist of successive dependent stages; pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. There is a real need to employ deep learning methodologies so that the performance of previous WBCs identification systems can be increased. Classifying small limited datasets through deep learning systems is a major challenge and should be investigated. Methods In this paper, we propose a novel identification system for WBCs based on deep convolutional neural networks. Two methodologies based on transfer learning are followed: transfer learning based on deep activation features and fine-tuning of existed deep networks. Deep acrivation featues are extracted from several pre-trained networks and employed in a traditional identification system. Moreover, a novel end-to-end convolutional deep architecture called “WBCsNet” is proposed and built from scratch. Finally, a limited balanced WBCs dataset classification is performed through the WBCsNet as a pre-trained network. Results During our experiments, three different public WBCs datasets (2551 images) have been used which contain 5 healthy WBCs types. The overall system accuracy achieved by the proposed WBCsNet is (96.1%) which is more than different transfer learning approaches or even the previous traditional identification system. We also present features visualization for the WBCsNet activation which reflects higher response than the pre-trained activated one.

Deep learning based models generally require large amount of labeled data for precise and reliable prediction. However, collecting labeled data is expensive because it often requires expert knowledge, particularly in medical imaging domain where labels are the result of a time-consuming analysis made by one or more human experts. As nuclei, cells and glands are fundamental objects for downstream analysis in computational pathology/cytology, in this paper we propose NuClick, a CNN-based approach to speed up collecting annotations for these objects requiring minimum interaction from the annotator. We show that for nuclei and cells in histology and cytology images, one click inside each object is enough for NuClick to yield a precise annotation. For multicellular structures such as glands, we propose a novel approach to provide the NuClick with a squiggle as a guiding signal, enabling it to segment the glandular boundaries. These supervisory signals are fed to the network as auxiliary inputs along with RGB channels. With detailed experiments, we show that NuClick is applicable to a wide range of object scales, robust against variations in the user input, adaptable to new domains, and delivers reliable annotations. An instance segmentation model trained on masks generated by NuClick achieved the first rank in LYON19 challenge. As exemplar outputs of our framework, we are releasing two datasets: 1) a dataset of lymphocyte annotations within IHC images, and 2) a dataset of segmented WBCs in blood smear images.","2020-10","2021-02-27 12:14:34","2021-02-27 12:14:34","","101771","","","65","","Med Image Anal","NuClick","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32769053","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\6HM9GZMR\Alemi Koohbanani et al. - 2020 - NuClick A deep learning framework for interactive.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32769053","","Annotation; Cell segmentation; Computational pathology; Deep learning; Gland segmentation; Interactive segmentation; Nuclear segmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peripheral leukocyte recognition by manual requires medical technicians to observe blood smears through light microscopy, using their experience and expertise to discriminate and analyze different cells, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive and subjective. The traditional systems based on feature engineering often need to ensure successful segmentation and then manually extract certain quantitative and qualitative features for recognition but still remaining a limitation of poor robustness. The classification pipeline based on convolutional neural network is of automatic feature extraction and free of segmentation but hard to deal with multiple object recognition. In this paper, we take leukocyte recognition as object detection task and apply two remarkable object detection approaches, Single Shot Multibox Detector and An Incremental Improvement Version of You Only Look Once.

Nowadays the morphological analysis of blood cells is operated manually by skilled operators, which results in some drawbacks such as slowness of the analysis, a non-standard accuracy, and the dependence on the operator's skills. Although there have been many papers studying the detection of WBCs or classification of WBCs independently, few papers consider them together. This paper proposes an automatic detection and classification system for WBCs from peripheral blood images. It firstly proposes an algorithm to detect WBCs from the microscope images based on the simple relation of colors R, B and morphological operation. Then a granularity feature (pairwise rotation invariant co-occurrence local binary pattern, PRICoLBP feature) and SVM are applied to classify eosinophil and basophil from other WBCs firstly. Lastly, convolution neural networks are used to extract features in high level from WBCs automatically, and a random forest is applied to these features to recognize the other three kinds of WBCs: neutrophil, monocyte and lymphocyte. Some detection experiments on Cellavison database and ALL-IDB database show that our proposed detection method has better effect almost than iterative threshold method with less cost time, and some classification experiments show that our proposed classification method has better accuracy almost than some other methods.","2017-08","2021-02-28 10:28:25","2021-02-28 10:28:25","2021-02-28 10:28:25","1287-1301","","8","55","","Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Springer Nature","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\29RIILXG\Zhao et al. - 2017 - Automatic detection and classification of leukocyt.pdf","","","ARTIFICIAL intelligence in medicine; BASOPHILS; Classification; Convolutional neural networks; Detection; EOSINOPHILS; LEUCOCYTES; LEUKEMIA diagnosis; Random forest; White blood cell","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, using image processing techniques, it is possible to automate the entire workflow, both reducing the operators' workload and improving the diagnosis results. In this paper, we propose a novel method for recognizing white blood cells from microscopic blood images and classify them as healthy or affected by leukemia. The presented system is tested on public datasets for leukemia detection, the SMC-IDB, the IUMS-IDB, and the ALL-IDB. The results are promising, achieving 100% accuracy for the first two datasets and 99.7% for the ALL-IDB in white cells detection and 94.1% in leukemia classification, outperforming the state-of-the-art.","2020-02","2021-02-28 15:26:48","2021-02-28 15:26:48","","1176","","3","10","","Appl.

An improved algorithm based on feature weight adaptive K-means clustering for extracting complex leukocytes is proposed. In this paper, the initial clustering center is chosen according to the histogram distribution of a cell image; this approach not only improves the clustering effect but also reduces the time complexity of the algorithm from O (n) to O (1). Prior to white blood cell extraction, the color space is decomposed. Then, color space decomposition and K-means clustering are combined for image segmentation. And then adherent complex white blood cells are separated again based on watershed algorithm. Finally, classification experiments based on convolutional neural network were performed and compared with other methods; 368 representative images were used to evaluate the performance of our method. The proposed segmentation method achieves 95.81% segmentation accuracy. The classification accuracy reached a maximum of 98.96%, and the average classification time is 0.39 s.

Currently, in the age of modernization there has been numerous research in the field of image processing incorporated with various segmentation and classification techniques to be able to generate alternatives for WBC classification and counting. However, the accuracy of these existing methods could still be improved. Thus, in this paper we proposed a new method that could segment various types of WBCs: monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils from a microscopic blood image using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) saturation component with blob analysis for segmentation and incorporate CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for counting which in turn generates more accurate results.","2018-04","2021-02-28 16:55:50","2021-02-28 16:55:50","","259-263","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\VWRVTIW6\8376476.html; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\7BW9ZRUP\Macawile et al. - 2018 - White blood cell classification and counting using.pdf","","","basophils; blob analysis; blood; cellular biophysics; Conferences; convolution; convolutional neural network; diseases; eosinophils; feedforward neural nets; hematology analyzer; HSV image processing; HSV saturation component; image classification; image colour analysis; image processing; image segmentation; Image segmentation; immune system; leukocyte classification; leukocytes; lymphocytes; medical image processing; microscopic blood image; Microscopy; monocytes; neutrophils; Object segmentation; segmentation; segmentation techniques; WBC classification; white blood cell classification; white blood cell counting; white blood cells; White blood cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 3rd International Conference on Control and Robotics Engineering (ICCRE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Leukocytes, also called white blood cells (WBCs) play main role of the immune system. Leukocyte is responsible for phagocytosis and immunity and therefore in defense against infection involving the fatal diseases incidence and mortality related issues. Admittedly, microscopic examination of blood samples is a time consuming, expensive and error-prone task. A manual diagnosis would search for specific Leukocytes and number abnormalities in the blood slides while complete blood count (CBC) examination is performed. Complications may arise from the large number of varying samples including different types of Leukocytes, related sub-types and concentration in blood, which makes the analysis prone to human error. This process can be automated by computerized techniques which are more reliable and economical. In essence, we seek to determine a fast, accurate mechanism for classification and gather information about distribution of white blood evidences which may help to diagnose the degree of any abnormalities during CBC test. In this work, we consider the problem of pre-processing and supervised classification of white blood cells into their four primary types including Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Lymphocytes, and Monocytes using a consecutive proposed deep learning framework. For first step, this research proposes three consecutive pre-processing calculations namely are color distortion; bounding box distortion (crop) and image flipping mirroring. In second phase, white blood cell recognition performed with hierarchy topological feature extraction using Inception and ResNet architectures. Finally, the results obtained from the preliminary analysis of cell classification with (11200) training samples and 1244 white blood cells evaluation data set are presented in confusion matrices and interpreted using accuracy rate, and false positive with the classification framework being validated with experiments conducted on poor quality blood images sized 320 × 240 pixels. The deferential outcomes in the challenging cell detection task, as shown in result section, indicate that there is a significant achievement in using Inception and ResNet architecture with proposed settings. Our framework detects on average 100% of the four main white blood cell types using ResNet V1 50 while also alternative promising result with 99.84% and 99.46% accuracy rate obtained with ResNet V1 152 and ResNet 101, respectively with 3000 epochs and fine-tuning all layers.

In addition, manual analyzing of the blood smear images for determining the various WBCs is a time-consuming issue for the physicians. In this paper, a hybrid method is proposed for the classification of the WBCs. Image processing (IP) and machine learning (ML) are used to determine and classify the WBCs in blood smear images. In the IP perspective, various IP algorithms are used to segment the WBCs and in ML perspective, feature extraction and classification are employed. RGB to HSV transformation, color to gray tone conversion, filtering operations, thresholding, and morphological processes are used for determining the WBCs. Median filtering and adaptive histogram equalization are used for filtering and image enhancement and Otsu thresholding is considered for thresholding due to its simplicity. Shape based features and deep features are used for characterization of the WBCs and long-short term memory (LSTM) network is employed for classification. A dataset containing totally 349 blood smear images is considered in the evaluation of the proposed method. 10-fold cross validation is used in experiments and classification accuracy is calculated accordingly. While the shape based features produce 80.0% accuracy, deep features obtain 82.9% accuracy.

With deep learning approach, handcrafted feature engineering can be eliminated because a deep learning method can automate this task through the multilayer architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this work, we implement a CNN classifier to explore the feasibility of deep learning approach to identify lymphocytes and ALL subtypes, and this approach is benchmarked against a dominant approach of support vector machines (SVMs) applying handcrafted feature engineering. Additionally, two traditional machine learning classifiers, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and random forest are also applied for the comparison.

The results of such examinations are important for the diagnosis of various diseases and for follow-up care after chemotherapy. However, manual, labor-intensive methods to determine the differential count lead to inter- and intra-variations among the results obtained by hematologists. Therefore, an automated system to conduct the white blood cell differential count is highly desirable, but several difficulties hinder progress. There are variations in the white blood cells of each maturation stage, small inter-class differences within each stage, and variations in images because of the different acquisition and staining processes. Moreover, a large number of classes need to be classified for bone marrow smear analysis, and the high density of touching cells in bone marrow smears renders difficult the segmentation of single cells, which is crucial to traditional image processing and machine learning. Few studies have attempted to discriminate bone marrow cells, and even these have either discriminated only a few classes or yielded insufficient performance. In this study, we propose an automated white blood cell differential counting system from bone marrow smear images using a dual-stage convolutional neural network (CNN). A total of 2,174 patch images were collected for training and testing. The dual-stage CNN classified images into 10 classes of the myeloid and erythroid maturation series, and achieved an accuracy of 97.06%, a precision of 97.13%, a recall of 97.06%, and an F-1 score of 97.1%. The proposed method not only showed high classification performance, but also successfully classified raw images without single cell segmentation and manual feature extraction by implementing CNN. Moreover, it demonstrated rotation and location invariance. These results highlight the promise of the proposed method as an automated white blood cell differential count system.","2017-12-11","2021-03-04 17:14:31","2021-03-04 17:14:31","2021-03-04 17:14:31","e0189259","","12","12","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\NNSQVMM9\Choi et al. - 2017 - White blood cell differential count of maturation .pdf","","","Blood counts; Bone marrow; Bone marrow cells; Deep learning; Machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; Neutrophils; White blood cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Automated profiling of erythrocytes from digital images by capable machine learning approaches would augment the throughput and value of morphologic analysis. To this end, we sought to evaluate the performance of leading implementation strategies for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when applied to classification of erythrocytes based on morphology.Erythrocytes were manually classified into 1 of 10 classes using a custom-developed Web application. Using recent literature to guide architectural considerations for neural network design, we implemented a “very deep” CNN, consisting of &gt;150 layers, with dense shortcut connections.The final database comprised 3737 labeled cells.

The main merit of this work lies in the proposed two-stage feature selection algorithm, which completely eliminates the chances of information loss inherent in traditional CNNs, occurring due to the suppression of negative values of features by rectified linear unit (ReLU) and also largely reduces the feature dimensionality. Moreover, it is the first algorithm proposed, which is capable of selectively suppressing the positive or negative values or none of each feature depending upon its respective significance in classification, in contrary to the previously proposed variants of ReLU. Firstly, it constructs a feature space for each CNN by performing inter-selection among its Fully connected, ReLU and InverseReLU features and selecting features possessing minimum Fuzzy Entropy and maximum newly formulated Total Contribution Score values simultaneously. Secondly, it performs intra-selection within each selected feature space, eliminating less significant features which simultaneously satisfy the redundancy and non-relevancy criteria stated here.

However, constrained by the past development of machine learning techniques, for example, extracting distinctive features from raw microscopic images are difficult, the widely used SVM classifier only has relative few parameters to tune, these methods cannot efficiently handle fine-grained classification cases when the white blood cells have up to 40 categories. Methods: Based on deep learning theory, a systematic study is conducted on finer leukocyte classification in this paper. A deep residual neural network based leukocyte classifier is constructed at first, which can imitate the domain expert’s cell recognition process, and extract salient features robustly and automatically.

With advancement in the field of image processing and machine learning, new and better methods are available for counting and classifying blood components. Deep leaning is training the computer with labelled data for classification tasks. Such techniques have shown high performance and accuracy. Most Deep learning models uses neural network architecture. One of the most popular type of deep learning model is Convolutional Neural Network.

CNN's extract the features from the image automatically using numerous hidden layers. Most Deep learning models use transfer learning that is fine-tuning a pre-trained model. RCNN stands for Region based CNN. Unlike CNN which is used for image classification, RCNN is used for object detection.

However, the morphological differentiation among different types of normal and abnormal peripheral blood cells is a difficult task that requires experience and skills. Therefore, the paper proposes a system for the automatic classification of eight groups of peripheral blood cells with high accuracy by means of a transfer learning approach using convolutional neural networks. With this new approach, it is not necessary to implement image segmentation, the feature extraction becomes automatic and existing models can be fine-tuned to obtain specific classifiers. Methods A dataset of 17,092 images of eight classes of normal peripheral blood cells was acquired using the CellaVision DM96 analyzer. All images were identified by pathologists as the ground truth to train a model to classify different cell types: neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, immature granulocytes (myelocytes, metamyelocytes and promyelocytes), erythroblasts and platelets. Two designs were performed based on two architectures of convolutional neural networks, Vgg-16 and Inceptionv3. In the first case, the networks were used as feature extractors and these features were used to train a support vector machine classifier. In the second case, the same networks were fine-tuned with our dataset to obtain two end-to-end models for classification of the eight classes of blood cells. Results In the first case, the experimental test accuracies obtained were 86% and 90% when extracting features with Vgg-16 and Inceptionv3, respectively. On the other hand, in the fine-tuning experiment, global accuracy values of 96% and 95% were obtained using Vgg-16 and Inceptionv3, respectively. All the models were trained and tested using Keras and Tensorflow with a Nvidia Titan XP Graphics Processing Unit. Conclusions The main contribution of this paper is a classification scheme involving a convolutional neural network trained to discriminate among eight classes of cells circulating in peripheral blood. Starting from a state-of-the-art general architecture, we have established a fine-tuning procedure to develop an end-to-end classifier trained using a dataset with over 17,000 cell images obtained from clinical practice. The performance obtained when testing the system has been truly satisfactory, the values of precision, sensitivity, and specificity being excellent. To summarize, the best overall classification accuracy has been 96.2%.","2019-10-01","2021-03-05 19:25:27","2021-03-05 19:25:27","2021-03-05 19:25:27","105020","","","180","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\3294K539\Acevedo et al. - 2019 - Recognition of peripheral blood cell images using .pdf","","","Blood cell automatic recognition; Blood cell morphology; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Fine-tuning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

That is why early detection and treatment of cancer is of utmost importance. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a type of blood cancer which is known to progress very rapidly and prove fatal if there is a delay in detection. Detection of this type of cancer is carried out manually by observing the blood samples of patient under microscope and conducting various other tests. This process may produce undesirable drawbacks: slowness, nonstandardized accuracy since it depends on examiner's / pathologist's capabilities and fatigue due to work overload can cause human errors in detection. A few automated systems for detection of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) have been proposed which involve extracting features from blood images using MATLAB and implementing different classifiers to produce results, which gave remarkable accuracies though not enough for practical usage. Our proposed system is further improving the classification accuracy. It uses openCV and skimage for image processing to extract relevant features from blood image and not just sheer number of features and further classification is carried out using various classifiers: CNN, FNN, SVM and KNN of which CNN gives the highest accuracy of 98.33%. CNN and FNN are written using TensorFlow framework. The accuracies obtained by other classifiers: FNN, SVM, and KNN are 95.40%, 91.40% and 93.30% respectively.","2018-09","2021-03-06 10:39:41","2021-03-06 10:39:41","","2359-2363","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\FUB3Z25G\Rajpurohit et al. - 2018 - Identification of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in .pdf","","","Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia; blood; Blood; blood cancer; blood relevant image feature extraction; cancer; Cancer; feature extraction; Feature extraction; image classification; image processing; image segmentation; learning (artificial intelligence); Leukemia; Lymphoblast; machine learning algorithms; MATLAB; medical image processing; microscopic blood image; Microscopy; Neural Network; patient diagnosis; patient treatment; Support Vector Machine; support vector machines; Support vector machines; TensorFlow; Training","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peripheral blood smear slides were prepared using the autostainer integrated with an automated haematology analyser and stained using May-Grunwald–Giemsa stain. These slides were analysed with Shonit™. The metrics for evaluation included (1) accuracy of white blood cell classification for the five normal white blood cell types, and (2) comparison of white blood cell differential count with the automated haematology analyser. In addition, we also explored the possibility of estimating the value of red blood cell and platelet indices via image analysis. Overall white blood cell classification specificity was greater than 97.90% and the precision was greater than 93.90% for all the five white blood cell classes. The correlation of the white blood cell differential count between the automated haematology analyser and Shonit™ was found to be within the known inter cell-counter variability.

With the FPM, we can get high resolution, wide field-of-view blood cell images at one time. After obtaining high-resolution images, we propose SO-YOLO as our detection method. As a convolutional neural network, the SO-YOLO outperforms the state-of-the-art detection methods both in accuracy and speed. The proposed framework in this paper can be used in clinical diagnose, because the experiment setup is flexible and the detection is fast. The data set in this paper is made with FPM by ourselves.

In this study, we use light microscopy and deep learning-based image analysis to classify the morphological changes of macrophages infected by Mycobacterium marinum (Mm), a surrogate model for Mtb. Macrophages were infected either with the mCherry-expressing Mm wild type strain (Mm(WT)), or a mutant strain with deletion of the esxA-esxB operon (Mm(ΔEsxA:B)). The mCherry serves as an infection marker to train the convolution neural network (CNN) and to validate the classification results. Data show that CNN can distinguish the Mm(WT)-infected cells from uninfected cells with an accuracy of 92.4% at 2 hours post infection (hpi). However, the accuracy at 12 and 24 hpi is decreased to ~75% and ~83%, respectively, suggesting dynamic morphological changes through different stages of infection. The accuracy of discriminating Mm(ΔEsxA:B)-infected cells from uninfected cells is lower than 80% at all time, which is consistent to attenuated virulence of Mm(ΔEsxA:B). Interestingly, CNN distinguishes Mm(WT)-infected cells from Mm(ΔEsxA:B)-infected cells with Δ90% accuracy, implicating EsxA induces unique morphological changes in macrophages. Deconvolutional analysis successfully reconstructed the morphological features used by CNN for classification, which are indistinguishable to naked eyes and distinct from intracellular mycobacteria. This study presents a deep learning-aided imaging analytical tool that can accurately detect virulent mycobacteria-infected macrophages by cellular morphological changes. The observed morphological changes induced by EsxA warrant further studies to fill the gap from molecular actions of bacterial virulence factors to cellular morphology., Mycobacterium tuberlucosis (Mtb) is an intracellular pathogenic bacteria that poses a serious threat to public health. Detection of Mtb infection plays an important role in tuberlucosis (TB) diagnosis, prevention and treatment. Here, a deep learning neural network for image analysis is developed to detect mycobacterial infection in unstained macrophages by solely recognizing morphological changes. The trained convolutional neural network (CNN) can accurately distinguish infected cells from uninfected cells using regular phase-contrast microscopic images. Moreover, the CNN could further distinguish the infections caused by wild type virulent mycobacterial strain versus a mutant strain with deletion of virulence factors, which correlates virulence factors to specific morphological features and demonstrates potential applications in TB diagnosis and research.","2019-10","2021-03-07 10:06:33","2021-03-07 10:06:33","2021-03-07 10:06:33","1-13","","","212","","Transl Res","Morphology-based classification of mycobacteria-infected macrophages with Convolutional Neural Network","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 31287998 PMCID: PMC6755059","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\YNIIZR3D\Bao et al. - 2019 - Morphology-based classification of mycobacteria-in.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6755059/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The manual method of detecting and classifying abnormal cells of SCA patient blood film through a microscope is time-consuming, tedious, prone to error, and require a trained hematologist. The affected patient has many cell shapes that show important biomechanical characteristics. Hence, having an effective way of classifying the abnormalities present in the SCA disease will give a better insight into managing the concerned patient's life. This work proposed algorithm in two-phase firstly, automation of red blood cells (RBCs) extraction to identify the RBC region of interest (ROI) from the patient’s blood smear image. Secondly, deep learning AlexNet model is employed to classify and predict the abnormalities presence in SCA patients. The study was performed with (over 9,000 single RBC images) taken from 130 SCA patient each class having 750 cells. To develop a shape factor quantification and general multiscale shape analysis. We reveal that the proposed framework can classify 15 types of RBC shapes including normal in an automated manner with a deep AlexNet transfer learning model. The cell's name classification prediction accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of 95.92%, 77%, 98.82%, and 90% were achieved, respectively.","2020","2021-03-09 13:30:40","2021-03-09 13:30:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\U3SLD7JB\Abdulkarim et al. - 2020 - A deep learning AlexNet model for classification o.pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-deep-learning-AlexNet-model-for-classification-of-Abdulkarim-Razak/2c343841d9afae37f7e75107dd019b1a59ee39d4?p2df","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An automated classification system is capable of recognizing white blood cells that may help doctors to diagnose several diseases like malaria, anemia, leukemia, etc. Automated blood cell analysis allows fast and accurate outcomes and often involves broad data without performance negotiation. The state-of-the-art systems use a lot of different stages (feature extraction, segmentation, pre-processing, etc.) to provide the automated blood cell analysis using blood smear images which is a lengthy process. To overcome these problems, this paper presents an efficient peripheral blood cell image recognition and classification using a combination of the salp swarm algorithm and the cat swarm optimization (SSPSO) algorithm-based optimized convolutional neural networks (SSPSO-CNN) method. This paper uses the CNN approach to classify five peripheral blood cells such as eosinophil, basophil, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils without any human intervention. The other objective of this paper is to propose an improved version of salp swarm optimizer (SSO) using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to attain competitive classification performance over the database of the blood cell images. In this paper, the CNN uses VGG19 architecture for training purposes. The accuracy of the classification achieved with VGG19 models is 98%. The proposed model based on the CNN approach optimized by SSPSO achieves high classification accuracy and provides automatic peripheral blood cell classification. This method establishes the fine-tuning process to develop a classifier trained using 10 674 images obtained from medical practice.

Hence, correct identification and classification of the WBC types is of great importance. In addition, the fact that the diagnostic process that is carried out manually is slow, and the success is directly proportional to the expert's skills makes this problem an excellent field of application for computer-aided diagnostic systems. Unfortunately, both the ethical reasons and the cost of image acquisition process is one of the biggest obstacles to the fact that researchers working with medical images are able to collect enough data to produce a stable model. For that reasons, researchers who want to perform a successful analysis with small data sets using classical machine learning methods need to undergo their data a long and error-prone pre-process, while those using deep learning methods need to increase the data size using augmentation techniques. As a result, there is a need for a model that does not need pre-processing and can perform a successful classification in small data sets. Methods WBCs were classified under five categories using a small data set via capsule networks, a new deep learning method. We improved the model using many techniques and compared the results with the most known deep learning methods. Results Both the above-mentioned problems were overcame and higher success rates were obtained compared to other deep learning models. While, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning (TL) models suffered from over-fitting, capsule networks learned well training data and achieved a high accuracy on test data (96.86%). Conclusion In this study, we briefly discussed the abilities of capsule networks in a case study. We showed that capsule networks are a quite successful alternative for deep learning and medical data analysis when the sample size is limited.","2020-03-01","2021-03-10 13:36:19","2021-03-10 13:36:19","2021-03-10 13:36:19","101699","","","80","","Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\JB9KX2XE\Baydilli und Atila - 2020 - Classification of white blood cells using capsule .pdf; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\R73EBCTA\S0895611120300021.html","","","Capsule networks; Classification; Deep learning; Medical image analysis; White blood cells (WBC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and methods A self-established dataset was used in this study that was exempted from review by the institution review board, which consisted of 13,504 bone marrow smear images. One subset of the dataset with 12,215 labeled images was split into training (80%) and validation (20%), another with 1289 labeled images was used to test, in which each test entry consists of about 130 images. An instance segmentation method named Mask R-CNN was used to detect and classify the nucleated cells. Here, we train a trained neural network from scratch; for comparison, we also use a network pre-trained on MS COCO (common objects in context, a data set provided by Microsoft which can be used for image recognition, the images in MS coco dataset are divided into training, validation and test sets) and fine-tuned with our dataset and both were trained with same data augmentation scheme. Diagnosis systems based on trained models and “FAB Classification” (French–American–British classification systems, a series of diagnostic criteria for acute leukemia, which was first proposed in 1976) were developed for diagnosing the test entry as APL or as not. Average precision (AP) and average recall (AR) were used to evaluate model performance. Results The best-performing model had an average precision of 62.5%, which was the augmented pre-trained Mask R-CNN with average recall 84.1%. The average precision of the pre-trained model was greater than that of the model trained from scratch (P < 0.05). Augmenting the dataset further increased accuracy (P < 0 0.03). Conclusion Deep learning technology such as instance segmentation with Mask R-CNN may accurately diagnose APL in bone marrow smear images with an average precision of 62.5% when 0.5 as IoU thresholds.

The rapid growth of unusual lymphocyte cells leads to bone marrow failure, which may slow down the production of new blood cells, and hence increases patient morbidity and mortality. Age is a crucial clinical factor in leukemia diagnosis, since if leukemia is diagnosed in the early stages, it is highly curable. Incidence is increasing globally, as around 412,000 people worldwide are likely to be diagnosed with some type of leukemia, of which acute lymphoblastic leukemia accounts for approximately 12% of all leukemia cases worldwide. Thus, the reliable and accurate detection of normal and malignant cells is of major interest. Automatic detection with computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) models can assist medics, and can be beneficial for the early detection of leukemia. In this paper, a single center study, we aimed to build an aggregated deep learning model for Leukemic B-lymphoblast classification. To make a reliable and accurate deep learner, data augmentation techniques were applied to tackle the limited dataset size, and a transfer learning strategy was employed to accelerate the learning process, and further improve the performance of the proposed network.

The proposed methodology includes the conversion of blood images to L*a*b color space from RGB, K-mean clustering for segmentation, and deep convolutional networks for classification. Transfer learning is employed to shift the learned knowledge of pre-trained networks including AlexNet and ResNet18. Statistical evaluation parameters are used to validate the performance of the system on the Munich AML Morphological dataset. The results show reliable classification accuracy of 93.30% and 93.85% for AlexNet and ResNet18 respectively.

Numerous machine learning algorithms have been developed to identify different diseases, e.g., leukemia. Leukemia is a white blood cells- (WBC-) related illness affecting the bone marrow and/or blood. A quick, safe, and accurate early-stage diagnosis of leukemia plays a key role in curing and saving patients’ lives. Based on developments, leukemia consists of two primary forms, i.e., acute and chronic leukemia. Each form can be subcategorized as myeloid and lymphoid. There are, therefore, four leukemia subtypes. Various approaches have been developed to identify leukemia with respect to its subtypes. However, in terms of effectiveness, learning process, and performance, these methods require improvements. This study provides an Internet of Medical Things- (IoMT-) based framework to enhance and provide a quick and safe identification of leukemia. In the proposed IoMT system, with the help of cloud computing, clinical gadgets are linked to network resources. The system allows real-time coordination for testing, diagnosis, and treatment of leukemia among patients and healthcare professionals, which may save both time and efforts of patients and clinicians. Moreover, the presented framework is also helpful for resolving the problems of patients with critical condition in pandemics such as COVID-19.

There are five types of WBC. These are called Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils and Neutrophils. The number of WBC types and the total number of WBCs provide important information about our health status. Diseases such as leukemia, AIDS, autoimmune diseases, immune deficiencies, blood diseases can be diagnosed based on the number of WBCs. In this study, a computer-aided automated system that can easily identify and locate WBC types in blood images has been proposed. Current blood test devices usually detect WBCs with traditional image processing methods such as preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. Deep learning methodology is superior to traditional image processing methods in literature. In addition, traditional methods require the appearance of the whole object to be able to recognize objects. Contrary to traditional methods, convolutional neural networks (CNN), a deep learning architecture, can extract features from a part of an object and perform object recognition. In this case, a CNN-based system shows a higher performance in recognizing partially visible cells for reasons such as overlap or only partial visibility of the image. Therefore, it has been the motivation of this study to increase the performance of existing blood test devices with deep learning method. Blood cells have been identified and classified by Regional Based Convolutional Neural Networks. Designed architectures have been trained and tested by combining BCCD data set and LISC data set. Regional Convolutional Neural Networks (R – CNN) has been used as a methodology. In this way, different cell types within the same image have been classified simultaneously with a detector. While training CNN which is the basis of R – CNN architecture; AlexNet, VGG16, GoogLeNet, ResNet50 architectures have been tested with full learning and transfer learning. At the end of the study, the system has showed 100% success in determining WBC cells. ResNet50, one of the CNN architectures, has showed the best performance with transfer learning. Cell types of Lymphocyte were determined with 99.52% accuracy rate, Monocyte with 98.40% accuracy rate, Basophil with 98.48% accuracy rate, Eosinophil with 96.16% accuracy rate and Neutrophil with 95.04% accuracy rate.","2020-02-01","2021-03-10 15:23:21","2021-03-10 15:23:21","2021-03-10 15:23:21","109472","","","135","","Medical Hypotheses","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\2VMXHY53\Kutlu et al. - 2020 - White blood cells detection and classification bas.pdf","","","Deep learning; Regional-based convolutional neural networks; White blood cell detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over time several methods have been proposed to classify these WBCs into their subtypes namely Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Basophils, Lymphocytes, and Monocytes which helps in the estimation of the body’s WBC count. These methods range from various morphological image processing-based methodologies to advanced deep neural systems. Due to the superior ability of neural systems to achieve the state of the art results more research is been carried out in this field. However, most of the such previously proposed methods have concentrated only in establishing and explaining the overall methodology for achieving high accuracy scores and less emphasis has been made in discussing the impact of modular changes in such methodologies like the impact of various activation functions, optimizers and data pre-processing methods very explicitly for this problem. This has led to a deficiency of work to be carried out with very recently developed activation functions and more essentially optimization algorithms other than backpropagation. It is extremely essential to explore and analyse different modules of the methodology to accelerate future research work further which might possibly help the research community in achieving a much better and efficient solution. This paper compares various architectures and discusses the behaviour and impact of different hyperparameters and proposes a novel methodology by incorporating recently developed swish activation to enhance the results.

We here present an improved hybrid approach for efficient classification of WBC Leukemia. We first extract features from WBC images using VGGNet, a powerful CNN architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet. The extracted features are then filtered using a statistically enhanced Salp Swarm Algorithm (SESSA). This bio-inspired optimization algorithm selects the most relevant features and removes highly correlated and noisy features. We applied the proposed approach to two public WBC Leukemia reference datasets and achieve both high accuracy and reduced computational complexity. The SESSA optimization selected only 1 K out of 25 K features extracted with VGGNet, while improving accuracy at the same time. The results are among the best achieved on these datasets and outperform several convolutional network models.

Most cases of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) develop from cells that would turn into white blood cells (other than lymphocytes), but some cases of ALL develop in blood-forming cells of various kinds. Anything begins in the bone marrow (the soft inner part of some bones, where new blood cells are made), yet it moves rapidly into the blood by and large. It may spread to various parts of the body once in a while, including the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, central nervous system (cerebrum and spinal cord), and testicles. The traditional method used by doctors to detect ALL is tedious and time consuming. It consists of several methods such as blood testing, aspiration and biopsy to the bone marrow, image testing using CT scanning and MRI. These methods take time and are expensive. The proposed approach uses imaging processing techniques to detect irregular blood cells in the microscopic images of the blood. Using the training data collection, the program is trained using DCNN and is uploaded into HDFS Hadoop framework. The learned method classifies when a new image is inserted into the program whether the collected picture includes cancerous leukemia cells or irregular cells. This way the process of detection of leukemia is automated and can be accessed by any of the hospitals with connected to the cloud system.","2020-07","2021-03-11 13:47:59","2021-03-11 13:47:59","","530-536","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\2FG2J3G9\K et al. - 2020 - Cloud based Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Detection.pdf","","","learning (artificial intelligence); image classification; deep convolutional neural networks; cancer; medical image processing; blood; Cells (biology); cellular biophysics; convolutional neural nets; image segmentation; white blood cells; liver; Medical services; Bones; Blood platelets; DCNN; Conferences; lymphocytes; bone marrow; bone; biomedical MRI; computerised tomography; Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL); aspiration; biopsy; blood testing; blood-forming cells; cancerous leukemia cells; central nervous system; cerebrum; cloud based acute lymphoblastic leukemia detection; cloud computing; Computer science; CT scanning; HDFS; HDFS Hadoop framework; image testing; irregular blood cells; lymph nodes; Microscopic blood image; MRI; spinal cord; spleen system; testicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 Second International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this way, it becomes possible to achieve high successes when modelling on the same domain. Unfortunately, in real-world problems, direct transfer between domains is adversely affected due to differences in the data collection process and the internal dynamics of the data. In order to cope with such drawbacks, researchers use a method called “domain adaptation”, which enables the successful transfer of information learned in one domain to other domains. In this study, a model that can be used in the classification of white blood cells (WBC) and is not affected by domain differences was proposed. Methods: Only one data set was used as source domain, and an adaptation process was created that made possible the learned knowledge to be used effectively in other domains (multi-target domain adaptation). While constructing the model, we employed data augmentation, data generation and fine-tuning processes, respectively. Results: The proposed model has been able to extract “domain-invariant” features and achieved high success rates in the tests performed on nine different data sets. Multi-target domain adaptation accuracy was measured as %98.09. Conclusions: At the end of the study, it has been observed that the proposed model ignores the domain differences and it can adapt in a successful way to target domains. In this way, it becomes possible to classify unlabeled samples rapidly by using only a few number of labeled ones.","2020-11-01","2021-03-11 13:49:24","2021-03-11 13:49:24","2021-03-11 13:49:24","105645","","","196","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\KWS7RMCD\Baydilli et al. - 2020 - Learn from one data set to classify all – A multi-.pdf","","","Classification; Deep learning; Medical data analysis; Multi-target domain adaptation; White blood cells (WBC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The key function of red blood cells (erythrocytes) is to supply all the parts of the human body with oxygen. Red blood cells (RBCs) form a crescent or sickle shape when sickle cell anemia affects them. This abnormal shape makes it difficult for sickle cells to move through the bloodstream, hence decreasing the oxygen flow. The precise classification of RBCs is the first step toward accurate diagnosis, which aids in evaluating the danger level of sickle cell anemia. The manual classification methods of erythrocytes require immense time, and it is possible that errors may be made throughout the classification stage. Traditional computer-aided techniques, which have been employed for erythrocyte classification, are based on handcrafted features techniques, and their performance relies on the selected features. They also are very sensitive to different sizes, colors, and complex shapes. However, microscopy images of erythrocytes are very complex in shape with different sizes. To this end, this research proposes lightweight deep learning models that classify the erythrocytes into three classes: circular (normal), elongated (sickle cells), and other blood content. These models are different in the number of layers and learnable filters. The available datasets of red blood cells with sickle cell disease are very small for training deep learning models. Therefore, addressing the lack of training data is the main aim of this paper. To tackle this issue and optimize the performance, the transfer learning technique is utilized. Transfer learning does not significantly affect performance on medical image tasks when the source domain is completely different from the target domain. In some cases, it can degrade the performance. Hence, we have applied the same domain transfer learning, unlike other methods that used the ImageNet dataset for transfer learning. To minimize the overfitting effect, we have utilized several data augmentation techniques. Our model obtained state-of-the-art performance and outperformed the latest methods by achieving an accuracy of 99.54% with our model and 99.98% with our model plus a multiclass SVM classifier on the erythrocytesIDB dataset and 98.87% on the collected dataset.","2020-03","2021-03-11 21:10:13","2021-03-11 21:10:13","2021-03-11 21:10:13","427","","3","9","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 3 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\YLJ2JMV6\Alzubaidi et al. - 2020 - Deep Learning Models for Classification of Red Blo.pdf; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\2T6A9UFG\427.html","","","classification; deep learning; erythrocytes; red blood cells; sickle cell anemia; transfer learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study proposes using bone marrow cell microscopy images and employs convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with transfer learning to establish an objective, rapid, and accurate method for classification and diagnosis of LKA (AML, ALL, and CML). We collected cell microscopy images of 104 bone marrow smears (including 18 healthy subjects, 53 AML patients, 23 ALL patients, and 18 CML patients). The perfect reflection algorithm and a self-adaptive filter algorithm were first used for preprocessing of bone marrow cell images collected from experiments. Subsequently, 3 CNN frameworks (Inception-V3, ResNet50, and DenseNet121) were used to construct classification models for the raw dataset and preprocessed dataset. Transfer learning was used to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. Results showed that the DenseNet121 model based on the preprocessed dataset provided the best classification results, with a prediction accuracy of 74.8%. The prediction accuracy of the DenseNet121 model that was obtained by transfer learning optimization was 95.3%, which was increased by 20.5%. In this model, the prediction accuracies of the normal groups, AML, ALL, and CML were 90%, 99%, 97%, and 95%, respectively.

To effectively automate the counting of blood cells, recently, the deep-learning-based detection method represented by the YOLO has been proposed and used successfully. Nevertheless, the YOLO detection method has difficulties in insufficient positioning of the bounding boxes and in distinguishing overlapping objects. To overcome the limitations, we propose a new deep-learning-based method, termed Attention-YOLO, which is achieved by adding the channel attention mechanism and the spatial attention mechanism to the feature extraction network. By using the filtered and weighted feature vector to replace the original feature vector for residual fusion, Attention-YOLO can help the network to improve the detection accuracy. The experimental results indicate that compared to the standard YOLO network, the Attention-YOLO can achieve a better detection performance in blood cell count without introducing too many additional parameters, where the recognition accuracy of cells (RBCs, WBCs, and platelets) has an improvement of 6.70%, 2.13%, and 10.44%, respectively, and the mean Average Precision (mAP) has an improvement of 7.10%.","2021-02-15","2021-03-11 21:29:18","2021-03-11 21:29:18","2021-03-11 21:29:18","323-333","","2","4","","OSA Continuum, OSAC","","","","","","","","EN","&#169; 2021 Optical Society of America","","","","www.osapublishing.org","","Publisher: Optical Society of America","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\58PGK3FY\Jiang et al. - 2021 - Improved detection performance in blood cell count.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

White blood cells are an important part of the immune system. The most important task of these cells is to protect the human body against foreign invaders and infectious diseases. When the number of white blood cells in the blood is not enough for the human body, it can cause leukopenia. As a result of this situation, the resistance of the human body against infections and diseases decreases. In this respect, determining the number of these cells in the human body is a specialist task. Detection and treatment of this symptom is a labor-intensive process carried out by specialist doctors and radiologists. Image processing techniques have recently been widely used in biomedical systems for the diagnosis of various diseases. In this study, it is aimed to use image processing techniques to improve the classification performance of deep learning models in white blood cells classification. To perform the classification process more efficiently, the Maximal Information Coefficient and Ridge feature selection methods were used in conjunction with the Convolutional Neural Network models. The Maximal Information Coefficient and Ridge feature selection methods extracted the most relevant features. Afterward, the classification process was realized by using this feature set. In this study, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet-50 were used as feature extractor and quadratic discriminant analysis was used as a classifier.

With the popularity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), computer-aided diagnosis of cancer has attracted considerable attention. Such tools are easily deployable and are cost-effective. Hence, these can enable extensive coverage of cancer diagnostic facilities. However, the development of such a tool for ALL cancer was challenging so far due to the non-availability of a large training dataset. The visual similarity between the malignant and normal cells adds to the complexity of the problem. This paper discusses the recent release of a large dataset and presents a novel deep learning architecture for the classification of cell images of ALL cancer. The proposed architecture, namely, SDCT-AuxNetθ is a 2-module framework that utilizes a compact CNN as the main classifier in one module and a Kernel SVM as the auxiliary classifier in the other one. While CNN classifier uses features through bilinear-pooling, spectral-averaged features are used by the auxiliary classifier. Further, this CNN is trained on the stain deconvolved quantity images in the optical density domain instead of the conventional RGB images. A novel test strategy is proposed that exploits both the classifiers for decision making using the confidence scores of their predicted class labels. Elaborate experiments have been carried out on our recently released public dataset of 15114 images of ALL cancer and healthy cells to establish the validity of the proposed methodology that is also robust to subject-level variability.

To learn more discriminatory information than the first-order ones, the second-order features are characterized. Afterwards, ARML encodes both the first- and second-order features with Gaussian embedding into the Riemannian manifold to learn the underlying non-linear structure of the features for classification. ARML can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, and the learnable parameters are iteratively optimized. 10800 WBCs images (1800 images for each type) is collected, 9000 images and five-fold cross-validation are used for training and validation of the model, while additional 1800 images for testing. The results show that ARML achieving average classification accuracy of 0.953 outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with fewer trainable parameters. In the ablation study, ARML achieves improved accuracy against its three variants: without manifold learning (AR), without attention-aware learning (RML), and AR without attention-aware learning. The t-SNE results illustrate that ARML has learned more distinguishable features than the comparison methods, which benefits the WBCs classification. ARML provides a clinically feasible WBCs classification solution for leukemia diagnose with an efficient manner.","2020","2021-03-12 17:48:10","2021-03-12 17:48:10","","1-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\E7GTTIX7\9152106.html; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\CL7829CM\Huang et al. - 2020 - Attention-aware Residual Network based Manifold Le.pdf","","","Attention-aware; Classification; Computer architecture; Convolution; Feature extraction; Machine learning; Manifold learning; Manifolds; Residual network; Task analysis; Training; White blood cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While manual counts are considered the gold standard, they are labor intensive, time consuming, and subject to bias. A reliable automated counter has yet to be developed, largely due to the inherent complexity of bone marrow specimens. Digital pathology imaging coupled with machine learning algorithms represents a highly promising emerging technology for this purpose. Yet, training datasets for BMA cellular constituents, critical for building and validating machine learning algorithms, are lacking. Herein, we report our experience creating and employing such datasets to develop a machine learning algorithm to detect and classify BMA cells. Utilizing a web-based system that we developed for annotating and managing digital pathology images, over 10,000 cells from scanned whole slide images of BMA smears were manually annotated, including all classes that comprise the standard clinical DCC. We implemented a two-stage, detection and classification approach that allows design flexibility and improved classification accuracy. In a sixfold cross-validation, our algorithms achieved high overall accuracy in detection (0.959 ± 0.008 precision-recall AUC) and classification (0.982 ± 0.03 ROC AUC) using nonneoplastic samples. Testing on a small set of acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma samples demonstrated similar detection and classification performance. In summary, our algorithms showed promising early results and represent an important initial step in the effort to devise a reliable, objective method to automate DCCs. With further development to include formal clinical validation, such a system has the potential to assist in disease diagnosis and prognosis, and significantly impact clinical practice.","2020-01","2021-03-12 18:04:46","2021-03-12 18:04:48","2021-03-12 18:04:46","98-109","","1","100","","","Machine-based detection and classification for bone marrow aspirate differential counts","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\NJIHZJZB\Chandradevan et al. - 2020 - Machine-based detection and classification for bon.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The classification of white blood cell images is crucial for leukemia diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to classify white blood cells by extracting discriminative information from cell segmentation and combining it with the fine-grained features. We propose a hybrid adversarial residual network with support vector machine (SVM), which utilizes the extracted features to improve the classification accuracy for human peripheral white cells. Methods Firstly, we segment the cell and nucleus by utilizing an adversarial residual network, which contains a segmentation network and a discriminator network. To extract features that can handle the inter-class consistency problem effectively, we introduce the adversarial residual network. Then, we utilize convolutional neural network (CNN) features and histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features, which can extract discriminative features from images of segmented cell nuclei. To utilize the representative features fully, a discriminative network is introduced to deal with neighboring information at different scales. Finally, we combine the vectors of HOG features with those of CNN features and feed them into a linear SVM to classify white blood cells into six types. Results We used three methods to evaluate the effect of leukocyte classification based on 5000 leukocyte images acquired from a local hospital. The first approach is to use the CNN features as the input of SVM to classify leukocytes, which achieved 94.23% specificity, 95.10% sensitivity, and 94.41% accuracy. The use of the HOG features for SVM achieved 83.50% specificity, 87.50% sensitivity, and 85.00% accuracy. The use of combined CNN and HOG features achieved 94.57% specificity, 96.11% sensitivity, and 95.93% accuracy.

In this work, we exploit the data augmentation as a hyperparameter optimization approach. We tested our methods to classify erythrocytes to assist the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia. In this study, we proposed a data augmentation approach based on hyperparameter optimization to find the best augmentation policies through the Bayesian optimization algorithm. We also developed a convolutional neural network architecture from scratch and compared it with two classic architectures to classify sickle cell images. Our approach defines the best data augmentation solutions and sends those solutions to be carried out by CNN in the final training. All experiments were validated using a stratified five-fold cross-validation procedure, and our best result achieves 92.54% of accuracy. The results suggest the best augmentation policies defined with optimization allow us to obtain superior results than other strategies such as without data augmentation, several randomly defined image transformations, and only random rotations.

Effective representation of multi-scale features is essential for fully perceiving and understanding objects, which guarantees the performance of models. However, in biomedical image tasks, the insufficiency of data may prevent models from effectively capturing multi-scale features. In this paper, we propose Feature Pyramid Block (FPB), a novel structure to improve multi-scale feature representation within a single convolutional layer, which can be easily plugged into existing convolutional networks.

In this work, we adopt a deep learning based semantic segmentation framework to solve the RBC classification task. A major challenge for robust segmentation and classification is the large variations on the size, shape and viewpoint of the cells, combining with the low image quality caused by noise and artifacts. To address these challenges, we apply deformable convolution layers to the classic U-Net structure and implement the deformable U-Net (dU-Net). U-Net architecture has been shown to offer accurate localization for image semantic segmentation. Moreover, deformable convolution enables free-form deformation of the feature learning process, thus making the network more robust to various cell morphologies and image settings. dU-Net is tested on microscopic red blood cell images from patients with sickle cell disease. Results show that dU-Net can achieve highest accuracy for both binary segmentation and multi-class semantic segmentation tasks, comparing with both unsupervised and state-of-the-art deep learning based supervised segmentation methods. Through detailed investigation of the segmentation results, we further conclude that the performance improvement is mainly caused by the deformable convolution layer, which has better ability to separate the touching cells, discriminate the background noise and predict correct cell shapes without any shape priors.","2020-11","2021-03-14 14:39:19","2021-03-14 14:39:19","","3095-3102","","11","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\NQPPJGIW\Zhang et al. - 2020 - Automated Semantic Segmentation of Red Blood Cells.pdf","","","Automated semantic segmentation; background noise; binary segmentation; Biomedical imaging; blood; cell morphologies; cell shapes; cell size; cellular biophysics; Computer architecture; Convolution; convolutional neural nets; deep learning; deformable convolution; deformable convolution layer; deformable U-Net; diseases; feature extraction; feature learning; free-form deformation; image classification; image quality; image segmentation; Image segmentation; image semantic segmentation; learning (artificial intelligence); medical image processing; Microprocessors; microscopic images; microscopic red blood cell images; multiclass semantic segmentation; RBC; RBC classification; RBC segmentation; red blood cell classification; robust segmentation; Semantics; Shape; shape recognition; sickle cell disease; sickle cell disease diagnosis; supervised segmentation methods; U-Net; U-Net architecture; U-Net structure; unsupervised learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many microscopic leukocyte image automatic detection methods are proposed. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied to microscopic leukocyte image automatic classification. But when a CNN is used for microscopic leukocyte image classification, the dataset’s scarcity and imbalance will lead to low classification accuracy. To improve classification accuracy, a data augmentation method is proposed, and a resampling method is adopted when using a CNN method. Methods First, a deep CNN model for microscopic leukocyte image classification is designed. Then, a new data augmentation method based on feature concentration is proposed to enrich the dataset and overcome the problem of dataset scarcity. To make the CNN model focus on the leukocyte region, many images are generated by putting a segmented leukocyte into images with different microscopic surroundings using an image processing method. Finally, taking the imbalance of the five kinds of leukocytes in the dataset into consideration, a resampling method is adopted. The resampling method iteratively feeds the leukocyte images with a low proportion to the CNN model within an epoch to ensure that images of each of the five kinds of leukocytes are represented in relatively equal numbers in each batch. Results The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed classification method can achieve 97.6% average testing accuracy. Classification precision for the five kinds of leukocytes is above 93.4%, while sensitivity is above 92.5%. Both the proposed data augmentation and the resampling methods improve classification accuracy.

The MicrosisDCN (Microbes Diagnosis with Deep Convolutional Neural Network) deploys Faster R-CNN in python script configures to access multiple GPUs computation with 7168 CUDA cores of dual GPUs with Linux command options: worker_replicas and num_clones equal to several graphics processing units. The datasets consist of hematocytes extracted from raw slides under a microscope. These images separate the cells of interest into three groups: red blood cell (RBCs), white blood cell (WBCs), and platelets. The training dataset consists of 80 percent of the 40,000 images. And the testing dataset consists of 20 percent of the 40,000 images. Our algorithm also provides the result of mean average precision (mAP) and enables multiple GPU training models in Tensorflow and OpenCV. The mAP is the average of average precision (AP) with intersection-over-union (IoU) in measuring the score of object detection accuracy. If the mAP score approaches 1.0, it indicates well accuracy. Our 9,000 steps valuation algorithm model by the python script estimates the mAP in 3 groups: RBCs, WBCs, and platelets as about 0.9147, 0.9664, and 0.9548. The optimum would be at nearly 12,000 steps because the algorithm estimates the mAP model as 0.96 in all types.

Using unstained images removes time-consuming staining procedures and could facilitate and automatize comprehensive diagnostics. To this aim, we propose a method that translates unstained images to realistically looking stained images preserving the inter-cellular structures, crucial for the medical experts to perform classification. We achieve better structure preservation by adding auxiliary tasks of segmentation and direct reconstruction. Segmentation enforces that the network learns to generate correct nucleus and cytoplasm shape, while direct reconstruction enforces reliable translation between the matching images across domains. Besides, we build a robust domain agnostic latent space by injecting the target domain label directly to the generator, i.e., bypassing the encoder. It allows the encoder to extract features independently of the target domain and enables an automated domain invariant classification of the white blood cells.

Obviously, the number of the genuine pairs is lesser than that of the impostor pairs. Thus, a data augmentation method suitable for leukocyte is used to enrich the amount of the genuine pairs. By training the Siamese network using the genuine pairs and impostor pairs, the Siamese network can not only shorten the similarity metric between the leukocyte and the same category of the typical sample but also increase the similarity metrics between the leukocyte and the different categories of the typical samples. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve 98.8% average testing accuracy.","2020-07-01","2021-03-15 14:22:56","2021-03-15 14:22:59","2021-03-15 14:22:56","1575-1582","","7","58","","Med Biol Eng Comput","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\PZI6C8HX\Wang und Cao - 2020 - A computer-assisted human peripheral blood leukocy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since Faster R-CNN achieves state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets, in this work, we use it to identify lymphoma cells from a dataset of blood cells.

This dataset will be used to fine-tune a pre-trained network. Then, we use two training methods and three networks to train the same dataset respectively. Finally, we choose the best trained model to diagnose lymphoma cells in a new dataset which also contains lymphoma cells, blasts and lymphocytes. The detection rate of lymphoma cells was higher than 96%, and the false detection rate was less than 13%, which is an improvement compared with the previously proposed results.

However, the challenge faced by conventional microscopy image analysis is the fact that cell recognition through a microscope is still time-consuming and lacks both accuracy and consistency. Despite enormous progress in computer-aided microscopy cell detection, especially with recent deep-learning-based techniques, it is still difficult to translate an established method directly to a new cell target without extensive modification. The morphology of a cell is complex and highly varied, but it has long been known that cells show a nonrandom geometrical order in which a distinct and defined shape can be formed in a given type of cell. Thus, we have proposed a geometry-aware deep-learning method, geometric-feature spectrum ExtremeNet (GFS-ExtremeNet), for cell detection. GFS-ExtremeNet is built on the framework of ExtremeNet with a collection of geometric features, resulting in the accurate detection of any given cell target. We obtained promising detection results with microscopic images of publicly available mammalian cell nuclei and newly collected protozoa, whose cell shapes and sizes varied. Even more striking, our method was able to detect unicellular parasites within red blood cells without misdiagnosis of each other. IMPORTANCE Automated diagnostic microscopy powered by deep learning is useful, particularly in rural areas. However, there is no general method for object detection of different cells. In this study, we developed GFS-ExtremeNet, a geometry-aware deep-learning method which is based on the detection of four extreme key points for each object (topmost, bottommost, rightmost, and leftmost) and its center point. A postprocessing step, namely, adjacency spectrum, was employed to measure whether the distances between the key points were below a certain threshold for a particular cell candidate. Our newly proposed geometry-aware deep-learning method outperformed other conventional object detection methods and could be applied to any type of cell with a certain geometrical order. Our GFS-ExtremeNet approach opens a new window for the development of an automated cell detection system.","2020-02-25","2021-03-15 16:29:02","2021-03-15 16:29:02","2021-03-15 16:29:02","","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2020 Jiang et al..

The detection of abnormal regions in WBCs is a difficult task. Therefore a method is proposed for the localization of WBCs based on YOLOv2-Nucleus-Cytoplasm, which contains darkNet-19 as a basenetwork of the YOLOv2 model. In this model features are extracted from LeakyReLU-18 of darkNet-19 and supplied as an input to the YOLOv2 model. The YOLOv2-Nucleus-Cytoplasm model localizes and classifies the WBCs with maximum score labels. It also localize the WBCs into the blast and non-blast cells. After localization, the bag-of-features are extracted and optimized by using particle swarm optimization(PSO). The improved feature vector is fed to classifiers i.e., optimized naïve Bayes (O-NB) & optimized discriminant analysis (O-DA) for WBCs classification.

The five types of white blood cells include neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and basophils, where each type constitutes a different proportion and performs specific functions. Being able to classify and, therefore, count these different constituents is critical for assessing the health of patients and infection risks. Generally, laboratory experiments are used for determining the type of a white blood cell. The staining process and manual evaluation of acquired images under the microscope are tedious and subject to human errors. Moreover, a major challenge is the unavailability of training data that cover the morphological variations of white blood cells so that trained classifiers can generalize well. As such, this paper investigates image transformation operations and generative adversarial networks (GAN) for data augmentation and state-of-the-art deep neural networks (i.e., VGG-16, ResNet, and DenseNet) for the classification of white blood cells into the five types. Furthermore, we explore initializing the DNNs’ weights randomly or using weights pretrained on the CIFAR-100 dataset. In contrast to other works that require advanced image preprocessing and manual feature extraction before classification, our method works directly with the acquired images. The results of extensive experiments show that the proposed method can successfully classify white blood cells. The best DNN model, DenseNet-169, yields a validation accuracy of 98.8%. Particularly, we find that the proposed approach outperforms other methods that rely on sophisticated image processing and manual feature engineering.","2020-07-09","2021-03-19 17:19:17","2021-03-19 17:19:17","2021-03-19 17:19:17","e6490479","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.hindawi.com","","Publisher: Hindawi","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\ZDTMGYNG\Almezhghwi und Serte - 2020 - Improved Classification of White Blood Cells with .pdf; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\MD6QX4TR\6490479.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In practice, the object detection accuracy is vulnerable to labeling quality, which is usually not a big headache for simple algorithm or model verification since there are a bunch of ideal public available datasets whose classes and tags are all well-marked. However, in real scenarios, image data is often partially or even incorrectly labeled. Particularly, in cell detection, this becomes a thorny issue since the labelling of the dataset is incomplete and inaccurate. To address this issue, we propose a data-augmentation algorithm that can generate full labeled cell image data from incomplete labeled ones. First of all, we randomly extract the labeled objects from raw cell images, and meanwhile, keep their corresponding position information. Next, we employ the framework of cycle-consistent adversarial network, but significantly distinguished from the original one, to generate fully labeled data including both objects and backgrounds. We conduct extensive experiments on a blood cell classification dataset called BCCD to evaluate our model, and experimental results show that our proposed method can successfully address the weak annotation problem and improve the performance of object detection.","2020-09","2021-03-22 15:40:46","2021-03-22 15:40:46","","2473-2480","","9","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\ZFH3SJ7W\He et al. - 2020 - CycleGAN With an Improved Loss Function for Cell D.pdf","","","BCCD; Biological system modeling; biomedical field; Biomedical imaging; blood; blood cell classification dataset; cell detection; CycleGAN; data augmentation; data augmentation algorithm; feature extraction; Gallium nitride; image classification; labeled cell image data; machine learning; medical image processing; neural nets; object detection; Object detection; pathology; Red blood cells; Task analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to meet these challenges, we propose a novel deep multiscale residual network (DMRN) for CTCs detection. Compared with existing methods either low-level hand-crafted features or CNNs with shallower architectures, our deep networks can acquire more discriminative features for more accurate detection. To train very deep networks more efficiently, we propose a set of schemes to ensure effective training and learning under limited training data. First, we apply the residual learning to generate more discriminative features and overcome the overfitting problem when a network goes to deeper. Then, a fully residual convolutional network (FRCN) is proposed to produce the prediction maps of CTCs. Finally, we propose to integrate multi-scale contextual information in proposed FRCN and fuse these prediction maps both global and local features of CTCs, making the prediction more accurate and robust. We built three DMRN models to study the impact of network depth on model performance. Each model was tested on our own dataset containing complex jamming information. The DRMN-50 model which has a depth of 50 layers performs best among three models with Jaccard-index of 0.810 (with a pixel accuracy of 99.8% as a reference index) and its performance outperform other existing state-of-art methods such as U-Net in other domain.

Cytological samples contain hundreds or thousands of nuclei that need to be examined for cancer. The process is tedious and time-consuming but can be automated. Unfortunately, segmentation of cytological samples is very challenging due to the complexity of cellular structures. To deal with this problem, we are proposing an approach, which combines convolutional neural network and ellipse fitting algorithm to segment nuclei in cytological images of breast cancer. Images are preprocessed by the colour deconvolution procedure to extract hematoxylin-stained objects (nuclei). Next, convolutional neural network is performing semantic segmentation of preprocessed image to extract nuclei silhouettes. To find the exact location of nuclei and to separate touching and overlapping nuclei, we approximate them using ellipses of various sizes and orientations. They are fitted using the Bayesian object recognition approach. The accuracy of the proposed approach is evaluated with the help of reference nuclei segmented manually. Tests carried out on breast cancer images have shown that the proposed method can accurately segment elliptic-shaped objects.","2018","2021-03-23 17:48:05","2021-03-23 17:48:05","","157-167","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\SJIL59G3\Kowal et al. - 2018 - Nuclei Detection in Cytological Images Using Convo.pdf","","","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Breast cancer; Bayesian object recognition; Ellipse fitting; Nuclei detection","Rutkowski, Leszek; Scherer, Rafał; Korytkowski, Marcin; Pedrycz, Witold; Tadeusiewicz, Ryszard; Zurada, Jacek M.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RBC storage lesions are often assessed by microscopic examination or biochemical and biophysical assays, which are complex, time-consuming, and destructive to fragile cells. Here we demonstrate the use of label-free imaging flow cytometry and deep learning to characterize RBC lesions. Using brightfield images, a trained neural network achieved 76.7% agreement with experts in classifying seven clinically relevant RBC morphologies associated with storage lesions, comparable to 82.5% agreement between different experts. Given that human observation and classification may not optimally discern RBC quality, we went further and eliminated subjective human annotation in the training step by training a weakly supervised neural network using only storage duration times. The feature space extracted by this network revealed a chronological progression of morphological changes that better predicted blood quality, as measured by physiological hemolytic assay readouts, than the conventional expert-assessed morphology classification system. With further training and clinical testing across multiple sites, protocols, and instruments, deep learning and label-free imaging flow cytometry might be used to routinely and objectively assess RBC storage lesions. This would automate a complex protocol, minimize laboratory sample handling and preparation, and reduce the impact of procedural errors and discrepancies between facilities and blood donors. The chronology-based machine-learning approach may also improve upon humans' assessment of morphological changes in other biomedically important progressions, such as differentiation and metastasis.","2020-09-01","2021-03-25 17:23:33","2021-03-25 17:23:33","","21381-21390","","35","117","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32839303 PMCID: PMC7474613","","; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\6QSRJ8FR\Doan et al. - 2020 - Objective assessment of stored blood quality by de.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839303","","Deep Learning; deep learning; cell morphology; Humans; Erythrocytes; Blood Banks; stored blood quality; weakly supervised learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CNNs achieved >94% in performance accuracy in differentiating NETotic from non-NETotic cells and vastly facilitated dose-response analysis and screening of the NETotic response in neutrophils from patients. Using only features learned from nuclear morphology, CNNs can distinguish between NETosis and necrosis and between distinct NETosis signaling pathways, making them a precise tool for NETosis detection. Furthermore, by using CNNs and tools to determine object dispersion, we uncovered differences in NETotic nuclei clustering between major NETosis pathways that is useful in understanding NETosis signaling events. Our study also shows that neutrophils from patients with sickle cell disease were unresponsive to one of two major NETosis pathways. Thus, we demonstrate the design, performance, and implementation of ML tools for rapid quantitative and qualitative cell analysis in basic science.","2019-11-15","2021-03-25 18:00:07","2021-03-25 18:00:07","","16891","","1","9","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31729453 PMCID: PMC6858304","","; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\G7UPBV9K\Elsherif et al. - 2019 - Machine Learning to Quantitate Neutrophil NETosis.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31729453","","Cell Death; Diagnostic Imaging; Extracellular Traps; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Necrosis; Neural Networks, Computer; Neutrophils; Phenotype; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While there are a number of well-recognized prognostic biomarkers at diagnosis, the most powerful independent prognostic factor is the response of the leukemia to induction chemotherapy (Campana and Pui: Blood 129 (2017) 1913-1918). Given the potential for machine learning to improve precision medicine, we tested its capacity to monitor disease in children undergoing ALL treatment. Diagnostic and on-treatment bone marrow samples were labeled with an ALL-discriminating antibody combination and analyzed by imaging flow cytometry. Ignoring the fluorescent markers and using only features extracted from bright-field and dark-field cell images, a deep learning model was able to identify ALL cells at an accuracy of >88%. This antibody-free, single cell method is cheap, quick, and could be adapted to a simple, laser-free cytometer to allow automated, point-of-care testing to detect slow early responders. Adaptation to other types of leukemia is feasible, which would revolutionize residual disease monitoring. © 2020 The Authors.

Red blood cells (RBCs) of SCD patients have diverse shapes that reveal important biomechanical and bio-rheological characteristics, e.g. their density, fragility, adhesive properties, etc. Hence, having an objective and effective way of RBC shape quantification and classification will lead to better insights and eventual better prognosis of the disease. To this end, we have developed an automated, high-throughput, ex-vivo RBC shape classification framework that consists of three stages. First, we present an automatic hierarchical RBC extraction method to detect the RBC region (ROI) from the background, and then separate touching RBCs in the ROI images by applying an improved random walk method based on automatic seed generation. Second, we apply a mask-based RBC patch-size normalization method to normalize the variant size of segmented single RBC patches into uniform size. Third, we employ deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to realize RBC classification; the alternating convolution and pooling operations can deal with non-linear and complex patterns. Furthermore, we investigate the specific shape factor quantification for the classified RBC image data in order to develop a general multiscale shape analysis. We perform several experiments on raw microscopy image datasets from 8 SCD patients (over 7,000 single RBC images) through a 5-fold cross validation method both for oxygenated and deoxygenated RBCs. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can successfully classify sickle shape RBCs in an automated manner with high accuracy, and we also provide the corresponding shape factor analysis, which can be used synergistically with the CNN analysis for more robust predictions. Moreover, the trained deep CNN exhibits good performance even for a deoxygenated dataset and distinguishes the subtle differences in texture alteration inside the oxygenated and deoxygenated RBCs.","2017-10","2021-03-26 09:45:17","2021-03-26 09:45:17","","e1005746","","10","13","","PLoS Comput Biol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29049291 PMCID: PMC5654260","","; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\QS2S3VTU\Xu et al. - 2017 - A deep convolutional neural network for classifica.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29049291","","Anemia, Sickle Cell; Computational Biology; Erythrocytes; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Microscopy; Neural Networks, Computer; Pattern Recognition, Automated","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we present a highly simple, rapid, and cost-effective liquid biopsy for ex vivo drug-susceptibility testing of leukemia. The method is based on an extreme-throughput (>1 million cells per second), label-free, whole-blood imaging flow cytometer with a deep convolutional autoencoder, enabling image-based identification of the drug susceptibility of every single white blood cell in whole blood within 24 hours by simply flowing a drug-treated whole blood sample as little as 500 μL into the imaging flow cytometer without labeling.

From our experiments we expect two stable geometries: the so-called ‘slipper’ and ‘croissant’ shapes depending on the prevailing flow conditions and the cell-intrinsic parameters. Whereas croissants mostly occur at low shear rates, slippers evolve at higher flow velocities. With our method, we are able to find the transition point between both ‘phases’ of stable shapes which is of high interest to ensuing theoretical studies and numerical simulations. Using statistically based thresholds, from our data, we obtain so-called phase diagrams which are compared to manual evaluations. Prospectively, our concept allows us to perform objective analyses of measurements for a variety of flow conditions and to receive comparable results.

Among these tasks, cell detection and classification are key steps in many computer-assisted diagnosis systems. Traditionally, cell detection and classification is performed as a sequence of two consecutive steps by using two separate deep learning networks: one for detection and the other for classification. This strategy inevitably increases the computational complexity of the training stage. In this paper, we propose a synchronized deep autoencoder network for simultaneous detection and classification of cells in bone marrow histology images. The proposed network uses a single architecture to detect the positions of cells and classify the detected cells, in parallel. It uses a curvesupport Gaussian model to compute probability maps that allow detecting irregularly shape cells precisely. Moreover, the network includes a novel neighborhood selection mechanism to boost the classification accuracy. We show that the performance of the proposed network is superior than traditional deep learning detection methods and very competitive compared to traditional deep learning classification networks. Runtime comparison also shows that our network requires less time to be trained.","2019-07","2021-03-29 13:34:19","2021-03-29 13:34:19","","1469-1476","","4","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\X65FVW87\Song et al. - 2019 - Simultaneous Cell Detection and Classification in .pdf","","","bone marrow trephine biopsy; Bones; cell classification; cell detection; Computer architecture; deep learning; Digital pathology; Feature extraction; Microprocessors; Stem cells; Synchronization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, deep learning methods are applied in bio-medical field to detect and count different types of cells in an automatic way instead of manual work in bone marrow examination. The process is mainly composed of two steps, segmentation and classification. Double backbone networks structure is employed to show better result. A two-step training strategy is also proposed. Mask-Region-Convolutional Neural Networks(Mask-RCNN) was used for detection and image segmentation to extract cells and then common architectures in convolutional neural networks pre-trained on ImageNet, such as Dense Convolutional Network and Deep Residual Network(ResNet), were fully experimented and compared in classification. Result of the first stage shows high efficiency to meet application requirements.

While this task is performed manually on microscope images in clinical routine, automating it could improve reliability and objectivity. Cell detection tasks in medical imaging have successfully been solved using deep learning, in particular with RetinaNet, a powerful network architecture that yields good detection results in this scenario. It utilizes axis-parallel, rectangular bounding boxes to describe an object's position and size. However, since cells are mostly circular, this is suboptimal. We replace RetinaNet's anchors with more suitable Circular Anchors, which cover the shape of cells more precisely. We further introduce an extension to the Non-maximum Suppression algorithm that copes with predictions that differ in size. Experiments on hematopoietic cells in bone marrow images show that these methods reduce the number of false positive predictions and increase detection accuracy.","2020-04","2021-03-30 12:50:42","2021-03-30 12:50:42","","249-253","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 1945-8452","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\9I73MEP8\Gräbel et al. - 2020 - Circular Anchors for the Detection of Hematopoieti.pdf","","","Biomedical imaging; Blood; Bone Marrow; Bones; Cell Detection; Cells (biology); Optimization; RetinaNet; Shape; Task analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite major advances in our understanding of the molecular and genetic basis of MPNs, the morphological assessment of bone marrow trephines (BMT) is critical in differentiating MPN subtypes and their reactive mimics. However, morphological assessment is heavily constrained by a reliance on subjective, qualitative, and poorly reproducible criteria. To improve the morphological assessment of MPNs, we have developed a machine learning approach for the automated identification, quantitative analysis, and abstract representation of megakaryocyte features using reactive/nonneoplastic BMT samples (n = 43) and those from patients with established diagnoses of essential thrombocythemia (n = 45), polycythemia vera (n = 18), or myelofibrosis (n = 25). We describe the application of an automated workflow for the identification and delineation of relevant histological features from routinely prepared BMTs. Subsequent analysis enabled the tissue diagnosis of MPN with a high predictive accuracy (area under the curve = 0.95) and revealed clear evidence of the potential to discriminate between important MPN subtypes. Our method of visually representing abstracted megakaryocyte features in the context of analyzed patient cohorts facilitates the interpretation and monitoring of samples in a manner that is beyond conventional approaches. The automated BMT phenotyping approach described here has significant potential as an adjunct to standard genetic and molecular testing in established or suspected MPN patients, either as part of the routine diagnostic pathway or in the assessment of disease progression/response to treatment.","2020-07-24","2021-03-30 12:58:06","2021-03-30 12:58:06","2021-03-30 12:58:06","3284-3294","","14","4","","Blood Advances","Artificial intelligence–based morphological fingerprinting of megakaryocytes","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\A26B7WAM\Sirinukunwattana et al. - 2020 - Artificial intelligence–based morphological finger.pdf; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\PDGDLLL2\Artificial-intelligence-based-morphological.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to the enormous variability (cell types, stains and different microscopes) and data complexity (cell overlapping, inhomogeneous intensities, background clutters and image artifacts), robust and accurate nucleus/cell detection is usually a difficult problem. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-scale fully convolutional neural networks approach for regression of a density map to robustly detect the nuclei of pathology and microscopy images. The procedure can be divided into three main stages. Initially, instead of working on the simple dot label space, regression on the proposed structured proximity space for patches is performed so that centers of image patches are explicitly forced to produce larger values than their adjacent areas. Then, several multi-scale fully convolutional regression networks are developed for this task; this will enlarge the receptive field and not only can detect the single, small size cells, but also benefit to detecting cells with big size and overlapping states. In this stage, we copy the full feature maps from the contracting path and merge with the feature maps of the expansive path. This operation will make full use of shallow and deep semantic information of the networks. The networks do not have any fully connected layers; this strategy allows the seamless probability map prediction of arbitrarily large images. At the same time, data augmentations (e.g., small range shift, zoom and randomly flip) are carefully used to enhance the robustness of detection. Finally, morphological operations and suitable filters are employed and some prior information is introduced to find the centers of the cells more robustly. Our method achieves about 99.25% detection precision and the F1-measure is 0.9924 on fluorescence microscopy cell images; about 85.90% detection precision and the F1-measure is 0.9020 on Lymphocyte cell images and about 78.41% detection precision and the F1-measure is 0.8440 on breast histopathological images. This result leads to a promising detection performance that equates and sometimes exceeds the recently published leading detection approaches with the same benchmark datasets.","2018-11-01","2021-03-30 13:36:12","2021-03-30 13:36:12","2021-03-30 13:36:12","1721-1743","","6","21","","World Wide Web","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\LWVF8C8Q\Pan et al. - 2018 - Cell detection in pathology and microscopy images .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, the density regression model (DRM) is designed as a concatenated fully convolutional regression network (C-FCRN) to employ multi-scale image features for the estimation of cell density maps from given images. Second, auxiliary convolutional neural networks (AuxCNNs) are employed to assist in the training of intermediate layers of the designed C-FCRN to improve the DRM performance on unseen datasets.

Although deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and the traditional machine learning methods have shown good results in the classification of blood cell images, they are unable to fully exploit the long-term dependence relationship between certain key features of images and image labels. To resolve this problem, we have introduced the recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Specifically, we combined the CNN and RNN in order to propose the CNN-RNN framework that can deepen the understanding of image content and learn the structured features of images and to begin endto-end training of big data in medical image analysis. In particular, we apply the transfer learning method to transfer the weight parameters that were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to the CNN section and adopted a custom loss function to allow our network to train and converge faster and with more accurate weight parameters. Experimental results show that compared with the other CNN models such as ResNet and Inception V3, our proposed network model is more accurate and efficient in classifying blood cell images.","2018","2021-04-13 17:06:39","2021-04-13 17:06:39","","36188-36197","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\WKDNT2IU\8402091.html; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\YXVUBBJI\Liang et al. - 2018 - Combining Convolutional Neural Network With Recurs.pdf","","","Artificial intelligence; Classification algorithms; convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural networks; Feature extraction; Image classification; recurrent neural network; Support vector machines; transfer learning; White blood cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their aberrant number, both abnormal increase and decrease, is a sign of an ongoing pathology, a precise evaluation of their number is of the utmost importance as the first step of assessing a potential disease. In blood cell microscopic images, since red blood cells and platelets are similar in color with WBCs, and WBCs are partially adhesive, WBC segmentation for counting is often not resulting in a good performance. Therefore, in this work, a color space transformation is proposed to filter out red blood cells and platelets, which is transforming the blood cell microscopic images of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia from RGB color space to HSV to detect and extract WBCs. For precisely segmenting adhesive WBCs in extraction results, we set cell border to the third class, in addition to foreground and background. A weighted cross-entropy loss function based on class weight and distance transformation weight enhanced U-Net to learn cell border features. Our results showed that the method proposed in this paper for WBC segmentation using the data set ALL_IDB1 could achieve an accuracy of 97.92%.","2020","2021-07-13 08:53:50","2021-07-13 08:54:30","","24808-24818","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\LJY37MCX\8976089.html; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\499GKBGR\Li et al. - 2020 - Color Space Transformation and Multi-Class Weighte.pdf","","","Blood platelets; Color space transformation; Colored noise; Image color analysis; Image segmentation; Interference; multi-class segmentation; Red blood cells; weighted loss function; white blood cell segmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are hematopoietic neoplasms characterized by dysplastic and ineffective hematopoiesis, which diagnosis is mainly based on morphological findings of PB and bone marrow. We developed an automated diagnostic support system of MDS by combining an automated blood cell image-recognition system using a deep learning system (DLS) powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a decision-making system using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The DLS of blood cell image-recognition has been trained using datasets consisting of 695,030 blood cell images taken from 3,261 PB smears including hematopoietic malignancies. The DLS simultaneously classified 17 blood cell types and 97 morphological features of such cells with >93.5% sensitivity and >96.0% specificity. The automated MDS diagnostic system successfully differentiated MDS from aplastic anemia (AA) with high accuracy; 96.2% of sensitivity and 100% of specificity (AUC 0.990). This is the first CNN-based automated initial diagnostic system for MDS using PB smears, which is applicable to develop new automated diagnostic systems for various hematological disorders.","2019-09-16","2021-07-16 14:21:16","2021-07-16 14:21:16","2021-07-16 14:21:16","13385","","1","9","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Diagnostic markers;Myelodysplastic syndrome Subject_term_id: diagnostic-markers;myelodysplastic-syndrome","","C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\EL4W5SU5\Kimura et al. - 2019 - A novel automated image analysis system using deep.pdf; C:\Users\Sebastian\Zotero\storage\8T3CXZH6\s41598-019-49942-z.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
